                  <strong>Preamble</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribe is firmly committed to the principal of tribal self-government. Consistent with federal policy, tribal government provides a wide range of public services, including general governmental services, the maintenance of peace and good order, and the promotion and regulation of economic activities within the sovereign jurisdiction of the tribe. Pursuant to the inherent sovereign powers of the Tribe and the powers expressly delegated to the Tribal Council by the tribal constitution, the tribal government recognizes the need for creating laws to govern and protect its employees, especially where state and federal laws do not apply.</p>
                <h3 id="/us/nsn/mohican/council/code/EMP.01.01" data-order="|EMP|EMP.01|EMP.01.01|" data-ref-path="|EMP.01.01" class="h__section">Section EMP.01.01 — Purpose</h3>
                <p>The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Council recognizes that on occasion, differences may arise between employees and supervisors due to misunderstanding, lack of communication, or concern over supervisory decisions. The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Council further recognizes that employees of the Stockbridge-Munsee Community, comprised of all branches of government and business, need protection of their rights including a stable working environment and the right to file a grievance and seek assistance in solving on-the-job problems via the proper, established policies and procedures.  However, Stockbridge-Munsee Community employees do not have property rights in employment.  The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribe, through this ordinance, seeks to define and establish employee rights and to establish a grievance process allowing all tribal employees an opportunity to have recourse for their grievances.</p>
