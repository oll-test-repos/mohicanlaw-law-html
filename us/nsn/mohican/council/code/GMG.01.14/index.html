Compliance means issuing a warning citation, and, if not in compliance after warning issuing a citation, charging a fine, suspending the operator's license, revoking the operator's license and or reporting such violation to the NIGC.  The Commission may take all necessary steps as authorized under this law to remedy an emergency violation.  In a case of revocation of the operator's license, the Commission shall provide notice to the NIGC, subjecting the Tribe to potential closure action.  Nothing contained in this Section or in this Ordinance shall be construed as affecting a waiver of sovereign immunity.</p>
