An employee gaming license shall be effective only for the person to whom it is issued and only with respect to the gaming facility specified in the application.  Any such license may be transferred to a new gaming facility only upon prior approval of the Commission, upon written request of the licensee identifying the proposed new gaming facility, its location and the proposed gaming operator thereof.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> <span class="level-heading">Current and Valid Employee Gaming License Required.</span> Every primary gaming management official and every key employee of any Class II or Class III gaming activity subject to this Ordinance shall possess a current, valid employee gaming license issued by the Tribe. Eligibility for and obtaining a valid employee gaming license is a requirement of continued employment. The General Manager shall not employ persons who refuse to voluntarily cooperate with the licensing process. Any employee receiving an employee gaming license must carry that license upon his or her person during all working hours and must produce the license upon the request of any official with jurisdiction over the gaming activity.</p>

                <p class="quote "><em>In compliance with the </em><strong><em>Privacy Act of 1974</em></strong><em>, the following information is provided: Solicitation of the information on this form is authorized by </em><strong><em>25 U.S.C. 2701 </em></strong><em>et seq. The purpose of the requested information is to determine the eligibility of individuals to be granted a gaming license. The information will be used by the Tribal gaming regulatory authorities and by the National Indian Gaming Commission members and staff who have need for the information in the performance of their official duties. The information may be disclosed to appropriate Federal, Tribal, State, local, or foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies when relevant to civil, criminal, or regulatory investigations or prosecutions or when pursuant to a requirement by a tribe or the National Indian Gaming Commission in connection with the issuance, denial, or revocation of a gaming license or investigations of activities while associated with a tribe or a gaming operation. </em><strong><em>Failure to consent to the disclosures indicated in this notice will result in a tribe's being unable to license you for a primary gaming management official or key employee position.</em></strong> (Emphasis added.) <em>The disclosure of an applicant's social security number (SSN) is voluntary. However, failure to supply a SSN may result in errors in processing the application.</em></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> Each application for an employee gaming license shall, if required, be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee to be established by the Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(6)">(6)</span> Each application shall contain a False Statement notice as follows:</p>
                <p class="quote ">
                  <em>A false statement on any part of your license application may be grounds for denying a license or the suspension or revocation of a license. Also, you may be punished by a fine or imprisonment (U.S. Code, title 18, section 1001).</em>
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(7)">(7)</span> If another tribe has previously employed the applicant, the Commission or its agent may request investigative information from the other tribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(8)">(8)</span> The Commission, its employees and agents, and the Tribe, and its employees and agents, shall follow the confidentiality act. The identity of each person interviewed in the course of an investigation on an applicant for an employee gaming license will be kept confidential, as required by 25 CFR 556.4(c).  The background investigation shall include interviews with a sufficient number of knowledgeable people, such as former employers and personal references, so as to insure a comprehensive description of the applicant's character.  Compliance Department background investigation files shall be presented to the Commissioners on a need to know basis only.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)(9)">(9)</span> When a primary management official or key employee is employed by the Tribe, a complete application, with all of the information required under this <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/mohican/council/code/GMG.01.15#(c)" title="">Section GMG.01.15(c)</a>, shall be maintained.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Review Procedure for Employee Gaming License Application.  Before issuing employee gaming license, the Commission will follow the procedure set forth below:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> Perform or arrange to have performed the necessary background investigation for each primary gaming management official and key employee as required by this Ordinance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Such investigation shall include contacting each reference provided in the application and taking all appropriate steps to verify the accuracy of information contained in the application.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Fingerprints shall be taken by the Compliance Department.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Fingerprints will then be forwarded to either the State or to the NIGC for processing through the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Criminal Information Center to determine the applicant's criminal history, if any.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)(D)">(D)</span> The Commission may require asset and liability disclosure for key employees and primary gaming management officials to adequately protect the gaming enterprise and determine the suitability of a particular individual for licensing, license renewal or continued suitability for retaining a license.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> The Commission, or designated agent thereof, shall create and maintain an investigative report for each background investigation of a primary gaming management official or key employee.  The report shall include all of the following information:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Steps taken in conducting the investigation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Results obtained;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(C)">(C)</span> Conclusions reached; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(D)">(D)</span> The basis for those conclusions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> Make the required reportings, outlined in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/mohican/council/code/GMG.01.15#(k)" title="">Section GMG.01.15(k)</a> and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/mohican/council/code/GMG.01.15#(l)" title="">(l)</a>, to the NIGC prior to issuing a determination on the findings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(4)">(4)</span> Review the person's prior activities, criminal record, if any, reputation, habits, and associations to make a finding concerning the suitability of an individual for licensing.  Certain acts or other incidents may pose a bar to obtaining a gaming license as more fully described in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/mohican/council/code/GMG.01.15#(e)" title="">Section GMG.01.15(e)</a>.  Where the Commission determines that licensing of the person poses a threat to the public interests or to the effective regulation of gaming, or creates or enhances dangers of unsuitable, unfair or illegal practices and methods and activities in the conduct of gaming, a tribal gaming operation shall not employ that person in a key employee or primary gaming management official position.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(5)">(5)</span> Provide an opportunity for a hearing on the denial of a license, or for such other cause as the Commission may determine.  The Commission's decision on licensing is final although the applicant may petition the Commission for re-hearing in cases where they have new evidence to submit, or where they can demonstrate that the Commission made an error in their decision.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> <span class="level-heading">Standards of Suitability.</span> The Gaming Facility shall not employ an individual if there is evidence and documented history of unsuitability or if they pose a threat to the integrity and/or safety of the gaming operation or its employees.  The Commission shall create policy regarding additional standards of suitability and the application of those standards.  The following minimum standards and criteria shall be applied when determining an individual's suitability to obtain or retain a gaming license from the Commission.  These standards may be applied in any case where there is cause to question an individual's suitability, whether the cause arises from an individual's criminal history or from his/her reputation, habits and associations identified during the background investigation process.</p>

The Commission will take into account the severity of the crime and the number of crimes and other offenses that a person's background investigation reveals.  Some offenses are identified in the Gaming Ordinance as being an automatic bar to a gaming license.  In the event an individual's background investigation reveals a barring offense, they will be denied a gaming license.  They may be eligible to apply for, and obtain, a Tribal Gaming Waiver.</p>

These include but are not limited to violent acts against persons; verified reports or documented evidence of violence against persons without a criminal conviction; dishonest acts against an employee, person or institution with or without a criminal or ordinance violation; any type of verifiable wrong-doing that may present a threat or harm to the gaming establishment, its patrons or employees.</p>
