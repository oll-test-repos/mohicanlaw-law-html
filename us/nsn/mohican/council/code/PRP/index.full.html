                  <p>PART 1.         GENERAL PROBATE PROVISIONS</p>
                  <p>This Part begins by setting out the purpose and philosophy of this Probate Code.</p>
                  <p>Section 6.1.1 provides that the code should be liberally interpreted to meet the following objections:</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num">(A)</span> To ensure that the property of decedents passes to the rightful heirs or beneficiaries.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num">(B)</span> To comply with the decedent's wishes as much as possible.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num">(C)</span> To comply with tribal custom and tradition.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num">(D)</span> To provide a simple, efficient and inexpensive method for probate decedent's property.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num">(E)</span> To prevent the transfer of land our of tribal ownership and control.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num">(F)</span> To ensure that the rights of creditors of decedents are protected to the extent possible and fair.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num">(G)</span> To promote and further the Tribe's inherent right to self-governance.</p>
                  <p>It is very useful to begin a probate code by getting forth the purpose and philosophy to guide the court in interpreting and applying the code. The Tribal Council should carefully review these objectives to determine whether these objectives are appropriate and consistent with the needs of the community.</p>
                  <p>Section 6.1.2 sets forth a long series of specific definitions due to the fact that probate law in general and Indian probate law specifically has a unique language which often needs explanation.</p>
                  <p>Section 6.1.3 provides for a broad statement of jurisdiction. It provides for the exercise of the greatest possible tribal jurisdiction over the probate of the estate of decedents who were domiciled or owned real or personal property on the Indian Reservation. Jurisdiction is not limited to Indian decedents or to tribal members. Instead, it allows the court to assert probate jurisdiction over anyone who was domiciled or owned real or personal property on the reservation. It does not mean that the court must assert jurisdiction in all of the potential cases - but it does give the court flexibility to assert jurisdiction when it is appropriate.</p>
                  <p>Sections 6.1.4 and 6.1.5 allow for the use of tribal custom and tradition.  Section 6.1.4 is important because it allows anyone to renounce any property or interest and sets forth the procedure for renunciation of succession.</p>
                  <p>The remaining sections are standard general probate provisions as follows:</p>
                  <p>Section 6.1.6 - Allows relief when fraud is involved</p>
                  <p>Section 6.1.7 - Provides procedure for determining evidence of death</p>
                  <p>Section 6.1.8 - Allows for use of civil procedure and appellate review when appropriate</p>
                  <p>Section 6.1.9 - Sets forth judicial powers and duties</p>
                  <p>Section 6.1.10 - Sets out rules for records and copies</p>
                  <p>Section 6.1.11 - Allows for trials to the court</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/mohican/council/code/PRP.04.01#(a)">(a)</span> The following title shall hereinafter be referred to as the Probate Code. The objective of the Probate Code is to provide for the exercise of the greatest possible tribal jurisdiction over the probate of the estate of decedents who were domiciled or owned real or personal property on the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Indian Reservation. The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Council finds that probate procedure in the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court is in the best interest of tribal members in that probate may be concluded more economically and more expeditiously than by other jurisdictions.  Furthermore, the determination of how property is disposed upon a person's death is an exercise of self-governance crucial to tribal sovereignty.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">B.</span> The Lessor, in consideration of the granting of such loan by the Mortgagee to the Lessee, hereby consents thereto and grants permission to the Lessee to execute and deliver to the Mortgagee a Real Estate Mortgage covering the Lessee's leasehold interest in and to the property above described including improvements now existing thereon or which may be constructed thereon.</p>

This provision shall apply to any attempted termination by surrender of the leasehold interest.  Upon the Lessor obtaining the Mortgagee's consent or after termination of the Mortgagee's interest in the leased premises, the Lessee agrees that if the Lessee shall fail to comply with, or shall violate any of the provisions of this Lease, the Lessor or his authorized representative may declare the Lease forfeited after giving sixty (60) days written notice, and may thereupon take such action to repossess the premises and such other action as may be necessary to protect the interest of the Lessor as provided for by law, but such forfeiture shall not release the Lessee from paying all rents and other obligations contracted for or from damages for such failure or violation; PROVIDED, however, that in the event of such declared forfeiture, the Lessee's liability for rent contracted for shall extend only for the duration of that particular annual rental period for which said Lessee, pursuant to the provisions stated herein, would have paid in advance and not for the entire unexpired term of said Lease, whatever said unexpired term may be at the time of said declared forfeiture.  After the termination of the Mortgagee's interest in the leased premises, this Lease may be terminated upon the failure of the Tenant to comply with any of the provisions of this Lease.</p>
