It is understood and agreed between the parties hereto that, if any installment of rental is not paid within thirty (30) days after becoming due, interest at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum will become due and will run until said rent is paid.

                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">4.</span> <span class="level-heading">Conditions:</span></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">A.</span> It is mutually agreed by the Lessor and the Lessee that the express purpose of this Lease is to enable the Lessee to obtain a loan from a federal agency agreed upon by the Lessee or from a private lender for renovation, new construction or purchase of a home.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">B.</span> The Lessor, in consideration of the granting of such loan by the Mortgagee to the Lessee, hereby consents thereto and grants permission to the Lessee to execute and deliver to the Mortgagee a Real Estate Mortgage covering the Lessee's leasehold interest in and to the property above described including improvements now existing thereon or which may be constructed thereon.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">C.</span> The Lessor agrees that this Lease may not be terminated for any reason without the written consent of the Mortgagee as long as any of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage remains unpaid.  This provision shall apply to any attempted termination by surrender of the leasehold interest.  Upon the Lessor obtaining the Mortgagee's consent or after termination of the Mortgagee's interest in the leased premises, the Lessee agrees that if the Lessee shall fail to comply with, or shall violate any of the provisions of this Lease, the Lessor or his authorized representative may declare the Lease forfeited after giving sixty (60) days written notice, and may thereupon take such action to repossess the premises and such other action as may be necessary to protect the interest of the Lessor as provided for by law, but such forfeiture shall not release the Lessee from paying all rents and other obligations contracted for or from damages for such failure or violation; PROVIDED, however, that in the event of such declared forfeiture, the Lessee's liability for rent contracted for shall extend only for the duration of that particular annual rental period for which said Lessee, pursuant to the provisions stated herein, would have paid in advance and not for the entire unexpired term of said Lease, whatever said unexpired term may be at the time of said declared forfeiture.  After the termination of the Mortgagee's interest in the leased premises, this Lease may be terminated upon the failure of the Tenant to comply with any of the provisions of this Lease.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">D.</span> Lessee understands and agrees that any and all use rights heretofore held by Lessee(s) in the premises, are extinguished through the signing of this Lease and that the Lessee shall hereafter hold rights only by virtue of this Lease.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">E.</span> Upon expiration of this Lease, or upon its termination in accordance with terms hereof, unless such termination is due to default upon the part of the Lessee(s), Lessee(s) or any successors in interest shall be entitled to full enjoyment of the premises and Lessee(s) shall have the right to reassume their land assignment and all rights thereunder.  If not so eligible, Lessee(s) and any successors in interest shall, upon demand, surrender to Lessor upon expiration or other termination of this Lease complete and peaceable possession of the premises and any or all improvements thereon, which shall be the property of the Tribe.  Personal property shall remain the Lessee's property.  Lessee hereby agrees that in the event this Lease is not renewed or extended and the land assignment is not reassumed, the Lessee shall have the right to remove the improvements placed on the leased premises with the loan obtained under section 4(a) within thirty (30) days of the said termination date.  In the event the Lessee removes said improvements, Lessee shall be responsible for the costs of renovation of the premises, which renovation shall include removal of foundations, sanitary septic systems, sidewalks, fences, and the filling, leveling and seeding of the ground to restore the original condition as may be determined in writing by the Lessor as being in the best interests of the Lessor.  At Lessor's option, a bond may be required to assure compliance with such restorations prior to the removal of improvements in an amount sufficient to assure such restoration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">F.</span> The Lessee will keep the buildings, fences and other improvements on the premises in good repair and condition, excepting ordinary wear and tear, loss by fire, or unavoidable depreciation for destruction. The Lessee shall properly conceal all legal refuse areas.  The Lessee shall be responsible for construction and maintaining all improvements which may be required by applicable law and Lessee shall indemnify and save harmless the Lessor against all action, claims and damages by reason of the Lessee's failure to keep and maintain said premises and the improvements thereon as provided hereinabove or by reason of Lessee's non-observance of any applicable laws, ordinances or regulations.  The Lessor shall not be liable for any loss, damage or injury of any kind whatsoever to the person or property of the Lessee or sublessee or any of the Lessee's or sublessee's employees, guests, or invitees, or of any other person whatsoever, caused by any use of the leased premises, or by any defect in any building, structure, or other improvement erected thereon, or arising from any accident on said premises or any fire or other casualty thereon, or occasioned by the failure on the part of the Lessee's or sublessee's employees, guests, or invitee or arising from any other cause whatsoever; and the Lessees, as a material part of the consideration of this Lease, hereby waives, on Lessee's behalf, all claims and demands against the Lessor and agrees to indemnify and save Lessor free and harmless from liability for all claims and demands for any such loss, damage, or injury, together with all costs and expenses arising therefrom and in connection therewith.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">G.</span> If the Lessor shall sell or otherwise transfer title to the premises, he will do so subject to the provision of this Lease.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">K.</span> The Lessee agrees that he will not use or cause to be used any part of said premises for any unlawful purpose.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">L.</span> The Lessee or his successors in interest shall pay, if any, if and when the same become due and payable, all taxes, general and special assessments and other like charges including any and all license fees or charges properly assessed which may be levied, assessed or imposed during the term of this Lease upon or against the leased land and all interest therein and improvements and other property thereon for which either the Lessee or Lessor may become liable in relation thereto and Lessee shall hold harmless the Lessor from any such taxes and claims, or sale or other proceedings to enforce payment thereof.  Should Lessee fail to pay any such taxes, liens or claims when due,  Lessor may at its option, upon written notice to Lessee, settle or discharge any such taxes, claims, etc., and demand reimbursement by the Lessee together with interest thereon at the current local commercial bank rate.  Failure to make such payment within thirty (30) days of Lessor's demand shall constitute a breach of this Lease, and the Lessor may declare this Lease immediately ended with Lessee forfeiting the rent paid for that year, subject to the nontermination provision of section 4(C) and subject to the appeal procedures in 25 C.F.R. Part 2.  This provision shall not prohibit Lessor from pursuing its remedies at law to recover the amount it paid.  In addition to the rents, taxes and other charges herein provided, Lessee shall pay all charges for water, sewer, gas, oil, electricity, telephone and any other utility services applied for and used on said premises.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">N.</span> It is understood and agreed that this lease, or any amendment thereto, or encumbrance thereunder shall be valid only after approval by the Secretary of Interior or his authorized representative, delegate or successor.  Approval of this Lease will not constitute an approval of a mortgage secured in the loan from or guaranteed by Lender.  Subsequent mortgages, loans, or other encumbrances require separate approval from the Secretary.  No assent, express or implied, to any breach of any of the Lessee's covenants shall be deemed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of any covenants.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">O.</span> The Lessor shall justly compensate the Lessee for any impairment of Lessee's rights under this Lease or of Lessee's unobstructed use of the leased premises resulting from any condemnation of the land subject to this Lease or from the Lessor's grant of any easement or rights-of-way concerning said land.  Lessor shall not voluntarily grant any right of use to the subject premises that would materially interfere with the Lessee's rights to or use of the premises without the written permission of the Lessee and the Mortgagee, if the indebtedness remains outstanding.  Unless the mortgage interest has been terminated, any payment resulting from condemnation, or the Lessor's voluntary grant, shall be made jointly payable to the Lessor and the Mortgagee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">P.</span> The Lessee, his heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns, shall be required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations covering sanitation, plumbing, electrical, building, and other relevant codes.  Lessee agrees to pay the prevailing fee in Shawano County for a building inspection, if required by the Lessor.  Lessor may require that the inspection be done by the Shawano County Building Inspector, however Shawano County shall not have jurisdiction to enforce their codes.  Lessor has primary jurisdiction for adoption and enforcing such codes.  Lessor may, however, base its codes on Shawano County's codes.  The Lessee shall comply with all applicable Federal and Tribal regulations regarding leasing.  After the termination of the Mortgagee's interest in the leased premises; the Lessee must obtain the prior approval of the Lessor before any improvements of any kind are constructed on the leased premises.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">Q.</span> The Lessor and its authorized representatives shall have the right, at any reasonable time during the term of this Lease, to enter upon the leased premises, or any part thereof, to inspect the same and all buildings and other improvements erected and placed thereon.  After the termination of the Mortgagee's interest in the leased premises, this Lease or any right to or interest in this Lease or any of the improvements on the leased premises may not be encumbered without the prior written approval of the Lessor, and no such encumbrance shall be valid without said approval.  The Lessor reserves the right to require any terms and condition before any encumbrances may be made as to the leased premises as it feels will best protect the Lessor's interest in the leased premises.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">R.</span> Any notice required by or sent pursuant to any provision of this Lease shall be sufficient if it is sent by first-class certified mail.

Notice to Mortgagee shall be mailed to address provided to Lessor by Mortgagee or other lender.  The Lessee agrees to pay and discharge all reasonable costs, attorney's fees and expenses that shall be made and incurred by the Lessor in enforcing the covenants and agreements of this Lease.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">S.</span> While the leased premises are in trust or restricted status, all of the Lessee's obligations under this Lease, and the obligation of his sureties, are to the United States as well as to the equitable owner of the land.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num">T.</span> Nothing contained in this Lease shall operate to delay or prevent a termination of Federal trust responsibilities with respect to the land by the issuance of a fee patent or otherwise during the term of the Lease; however, such termination shall not serve to abrogate the Lease.  The equitable owners of the land and the Lessee and his surety or sureties shall be notified of any such change in the status of the land.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">5.</span> <span class="level-heading">Sovereign Immunity.</span> Lessor acknowledges and agrees that upon the occurrence of a breach of any of its obligations under this Lease, the Lessee and/or any Mortgagee or Lender, or its successors or assigns, may protect and enforce its rights by appropriate judicial proceedings against Lessor to be held exclusively within the courts of the Tribe.
