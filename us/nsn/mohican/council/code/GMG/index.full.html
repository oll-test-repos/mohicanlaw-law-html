At the heart of this policy is a commitment by the federal government to foster and encourage tribal self-government, economic development and self-sufficiency. That commitment was signed into law in 1975 as the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, 88 Stat. 2203, 25 U.S.C. Sections 450-450n. In 1983, President Reagan reaffirmed that commitment in his Indian Policy Statement, encouraged tribes to reduce their dependence on federal funds by generating more of their own revenues and pledged to assist tribes in that endeavor.  In 1988 the federal commitment to promote tribal economic development, tribal self-sufficiency and strong tribal government was expressly legislated in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act ("IGRA"), Public Law 100-497, 102 Stat. 2426, 25 U.S.C. Section 2710, et. seq. (1988), which recognized the inherent sovereign right of tribes to operate and their exclusive right to regulate on Indian lands gaming that is not specifically prohibited by federal law and is conducted within a state that does not, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibit such gaming, and provided a federal statutory basis for operation and regulation of Indian gaming.</p>
