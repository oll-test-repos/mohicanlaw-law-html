As the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag represents the Tribe's sovereignty, it shall be displayed according to the following requirements: (1) The Stockbridge-Munsee Flag may be displayed on all days. (2) The Stockbridge-Munsee Flag may only be displayed from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, the flag may be displayed twenty-four (24) hours a day if the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag is an all-weather flag and is properly illuminated during the hours of darkness. (3) The Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be displayed in every polling place within the reservation on Stockbridge-Munsee Community election days.

(b) Conduct during hoisting, lowering or passing of the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag. The Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously. (c) Position of the Flag. The position of the flag is an important symbol of prominence and sovereignty; therefore, the following requirements shall be adhered to: (1) When flags of two or more countries or Indian Tribes are displayed, the flags are to be flown from separate flagstaffs or flag poles at the same height and shall be approximately of equal size. (A) Since it is possible the Stockbridge-Munsee Community has a number of buildings with uneven flag poles, therefore when it is financially feasible to change flag poles all buildings will then fly the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag and the United States Flag at the same height and the United States Flag shall fly from the highest flag pole, when appropriate, and the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall fly from the pole furthest to the right to show prominence. (B) Additionally, any future flag poles shall be constructed in such a way as to comply with this law. (2) The Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be displayed to the furthest right in the position of superior prominence. (3) When other flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be hoisted first and lowered last. (4) When flags of other states, localities or pennants of societies are flown on the same line or rope used to hoist a flag with the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag, the Stockbridge-Munsee flag shall always be on top. (d) Manner of Display. The Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be displayed as follows: (1) When carried in a procession with another flag or flags, the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be either on the marching right; that is, the Flag's own right, or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of the center of this line. (2) When the Stockbridge-Munsee flag is displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be on the right, the Flag's own right, and its staff shall be in front of the staff of the other flag. (3) If the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag is displayed horizontally against a wall, the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be placed in the upright position. (4) If the Flag is displayed in a window, the flag shall be displayed in the upright position facing the appropriate way to an observer outside the building. (5) When the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag is displayed over the middle of the street, the Stockbridge-Munsee flag shall be suspended horizontally and shall be placed in the upright position. (6) When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, shall be displayed above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall hold the position of prominence, in advance of the audience, and in the position of honor at the clergy's or speaker's right as he or she faces the audience. Any other flag so displayed shall be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the audience. (e) Display of Respect. At certain times, the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be lowered to half-staff as a sign of respect. In doing so, the Flag shall be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to half-staff position. The Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall again be raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day. (1) On or prior to the following days, the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be lowered to half-staff: (A) Stockbridge Day (B) Memorial Day (C) Flag Day (D) Veteran's Day (2) As a sign of respect, when the United States flag is ordered to be lowered to half-staff, the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall also be lowered. (3) By a directive of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Council President, or his or her designee if the President is not available, the Stockbridge-Munsee Flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of a member of the Tribe and remain at half-staff until after the funeral ceremony. (4) The Stockbridge-Munsee flag shall be lowered to half-staff by directive of the Stockbridge-Munsee President for other reasons deemed appropriate. ( January 28, 2021, 062-19 .)

The Trial Court may not require the Tribe to submit any document other than a Summons and Citation or Complaint to commence an action to enforce a tribal law. The Trial Court shall have jurisdiction from such time as both the Summons and Complaint are filed and properly served upon the defendant. (b) Authentication of Summons and Complaint. Upon filing, the Clerk of Court shall authenticate copies of the Summons and Complaint by affixing them with the Tribal Court System stamp. (c) Service of Process. Service of process shall consist of delivering to the party served an authenticated copy of the Summons and Complaint. The Summons shall advise the defendant that he or she is required to answer the complaint within twenty (20) days or a default judgment may be entered against him or her.

(3) COMMUNITY HEALTH PRINCIPLE The health of the community at large depends on recognizing the connectedness of all things and the responsibility that we all have to each other.

(2) An opposing party may rebut a presumption that joint legal custody is in the best interest of the child with a showing by preponderance of the evidence why the parties will not be able to cooperate in decision making. Evidence of domestic abuse creates a rebuttable presumption that the parties will not be able to cooperate. (3) The Court shall not give sole legal custody to a party who refuses to cooperate with the other party if that refusal to cooperate is unreasonable. (c) Physical Placement. (1) A child is entitled to periods of physical placement with both parents unless the Court determines that physical placement with a party would endanger the child's physical, mental or emotional health. (2) The Court shall allocate periods of physical placement that allow the child to have regularly occurring, meaningful periods of physical placement with each party and that maximizes the amount of time the child may spend with each party, taking into account geographic separation and accommodations for different households. (3) The Court will not deny physical placement for failure to meet, or grant periods of physical placement for meeting, any financial obligation to the child. (d) The Court shall consider the following factors in determining legal custody and periods of physical placement: (1) The wishes of the parties, including the child's parents, or other family members, as shown through testimony or documents submitted to the Court. (2) The wishes of the child, which may be communicated by the child or through the child's guardian ad litem or other appropriate professional. (3) The relationship of the child with his or her parent or parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interest. (4) The child's adjustment to the home, school, religion and community. (5) Whether the mental or physical health of a party, child, or other person living in a proposed custodial household negatively affects the child's well-being. (6) The availability of public or private child care services. (7) The cooperation and communication between the parties and whether either party unreasonably refuses to cooperate or communicate with the other party. (8) Whether there is evidence of domestic abuse. (9) Whether either party has or had a significant problem with alcohol or drug abuse. (10) Such other factors as the Court may, in each individual case, determine to be relevant. (e) If the Court finds that a party has engaged in a pattern or serious incident of domestic abuse, the safety and well-being of the child and the safety of any party who was the victim of the abuse shall be the paramount concerns in determining legal custody and periods of physical placement. (f) If a party is a member of the National Guard or of a reserve unit of the U.S. armed forces, the Court shall not consider as a factor in determining the legal custody of a child whether he or she has been or may be called to active duty and consequently is, or in the future will be or may be, absent from home.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section YAE.08.10 \u2014 Custody And Physical Placement Orders (a) After considering all relevant testimony and evidence to make its determinations as to legal custody and physical placement, the Court shall issue a written order identifying the party or parties with legal custody and/or physical placement based on the best interests of the child. This order is not considered a sealed order. (1) If the action is contested, the order shall state the Court's determinations as to legal custody and/or physical placement and why they are in the best interest of the child. (2) In an order for legal custody, the Court may specify who may make certain major decisions for the child. The Court may give one party sole power to make specified decisions, while both parties retain equal rights and responsibilities for other decisions. (3) In an order for joint legal custody and periods of physical placement, the Court may specify one party as the primary caretaker and his or her home as the primary home of the child. (4) No party awarded legal custody may take any action inconsistent with any applicable physical placement order, unless the Court expressly authorizes that action. (5) In an order of physical placement, the Court shall specify the right of each party to the physical control of the child in sufficient detail to enable a party deprived of that control to request relief for interference with custody or parental rights. (6) If the best interests of the child demand it and the Court determines that neither parent is able to care for the child adequately or that neither parent is fit and proper to have the care and custody of the child, the Court may order the legal custody of the child be with a relative of the child or an appropriate governmental entity. (7) The Court may order that parties to participate in parenting classes, attend counseling, share medical or medical history information or meet other requirements as are in the best interest of the child. The party ordered to meet such requirements shall be responsible for costs of compliance. (b) If the Court grants periods of physical placement to more than one party, either or both parties may be granted a reasonable amount of electronic communication at reasonable hours during the other party's periods of physical placement with the child. Electronic communication shall not be used as a substitute for a party's periods of physical placement with the child. If the Court grants electronic communication to a party whose physical placement with the child is supervised, the party's electronic communication with the child shall also be supervised. (c) If the Court determines that joint custody is inappropriate, then the Court order shall state why the presumption of awarding joint legal custody is rebutted, what evidence rebutted the presumption, and why its determination relating to legal custody and physical placement are in the best interest of the child. (d) If the Court finds that a party has engaged in a pattern or serious incident of domestic abuse or other activity that endangered the child's physical, mental or emotional health, and the Court awards periods of physical placement to both parties, the Court shall provide for the safety and well-being of the child and for the safety of the party who was the victim of the abuse, if applicable. This may include: (1) requiring supervised exchanges of the child; (2) requiring supervised physical placement and/or visitation; (3) requiring a party to attend and complete a certified treatment program for batterers and/or alcohol or substance abusers; (4) prohibiting a party from being under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances during the exchange of the child or prohibiting a person from possessing or using alcohol or controlled substances during the period of physical placement; or (5) ordering any other conditions that the Court determines is necessary for the safety and well-being of the child and the party who was the victim of the abuse, if applicable. (e) Parental Access to Records. (1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court or except as provided under subsection (2) below, access to a child's medical, dental and school records is available to a parent regardless of whether the parent has legal custody of the child. (2) A parent who has been denied periods of physical placement does not have the normal rights of a parent in relation to that child's records, including a right to access such records.

(b) Whenever possible, the wishes of the child shall be considered when the Court is determining whether to grant visitation rights; however, it is presumed that a fit parent's decision regarding non-parental visitation is in the best interest of the child. (c) The Court may deny visitation rights to a person if he or she has been convicted of the intentional homicide of a parent of the child, and the conviction has not been reversed, set aside or vacated.

(B) Modification of Substantially Equal Physical Placement Orders.

(c) The Court may modify an order of physical placement, which does not substantially alter the amount of time a party spends with the child, at any time if the Court finds that the modification is in the best interest of the child. (d) The Court may deny a party's physical placement rights at any time if it finds that the physical placement rights would endanger the child's physical, mental or emotional health. (e) The Court may modify an order of physical placement at any time if it finds that a party has repeatedly and unreasonably failed to exercise periods of physical placement as allocated under that order. A failure to exercise periods of physical placement due to active military service shall not be grounds modify an order of physical placement.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section YAE.09.01 \u2014 Authority, Purpose And Scope (a) The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish the legal responsibility of parents to provide financially for their children's general well-being. The Stockbridge-Munsee Community finds its children are among the Tribe's most valuable resources and their financial needs must be met to ensure their success in the future. Therefore, it is the intent of the Tribe to define a process to establish, modify and enforce child support court orders involving members of the Stockbridge-Munsee Community, and all those subject to the jurisdiction of the Stockbridge-Munsee Community. (b) The Stockbridge-Munsee Community authorized the creation of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Child Support Agency (SMTCSA) (Agency) and hereby delegates to that Agency, through the Child Support Manager the responsibility and authority for implementing, monitoring and enforcing this Law. Included in this delegation of authority is rule-making authority to facilitate enforcement of child support orders and obligations. The enforcement authority delegated under this section includes the authority to make rules that govern the compliance of other tribal departments, businesses, agencies, boards, committees or other tribal entity that may be in a position to facilitate the collection or enforcement of child support obligations. An example of a Tribal Child Support Agency rule affecting a tribal department might, for instance, be a rule that requires the loan department to either deny a tribal loan in cases where a noncustodial parent payor was more than one month in arrears on child support payments or grant the loan conditioned on a portion of that loan being used to satisfy the outstanding child support arrears. (c) The SMTCSA is not an administrative decision-making body and is not subject to actions under Section TCT.02.23 of Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Law. This Chapter is expressly exempted from the operation of Section TCT.02.23 . (d) Nothing in this Law is intended to waive the sovereign immunity of the Stockbridge-Munsee Community or its application to the SMTCSA and its agents and employees acting within the scope of their authority.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section YAE.09.07 \u2014 Child Support Calculations (a) Child support shall be established utilizing the income of the parents and the guidelines in this section. (b) Determining Income Modified for Business Expenses. In determining a parent's monthly income, the Court may adjust a parent's gross income as follows: (1) Adding wages paid to dependent household members. (2) Adding undistributed income that the Court determines is not reasonably necessary for the growth of the business. The parent shall have the burden of proof to show that any undistributed income is reasonably necessary for the growth of the business. (3) Reducing gross income by the business expenses that the Court determines are reasonably necessary for the production of that income or operation of the business and that may differ from the determination of allowable business expense for tax purpose. (c) Determining Income Imputed Based on Earning Capacity. When a parent's income is less that the parent's earning capacity or is unknown, the Court may impute income to the parent at an amount that represents the parent's ability to earn, based on the parent's education, training and recent work experience, earnings during previous periods, current physical and mental health, history of child care responsibilities as the parent with primary physical placement and the availability of work in or near the parent's community. If evidence is presented that due diligence has been exercised to ascertain information on the parent's actual income or ability to earn and that information is unavailable, the Commission may impute to the parent the income that a person would earn by working thirty-five (35) hours per week for the federal minimum hourly wage under 29 USC 2016(a)(1). If a parent has gross income or income modified for business expenses below his or her earning capacity, the income imputed based on earning capacity shall be the difference between the parent's earning capacity and the parent's gross income or income modified for business expenses. (d) Determining Income Imputed from Assets. (1) The Court may impute a reasonable earning potential to a parent's assets if the Court finds both of the following: (A) The parent has ownership and control over any real or personal property, including but not limited to, life insurance, cash and deposit account, stocks and bonds, business interests, net proceeds resulting from worker's compensation or other personal injury awards not intended to replace income, and cash and corporate income in a corporation in which the parent has an ownership interest sufficient to individually exercise control and the cash or corporate income is not included as gross income. (2) The parent's assets are underproductive and at least one (1) of the following applies: (A) The parent has diverted income into assets to avoid paying child support. (B) Income from the parent's assets is necessary to maintain the child or children at the standard of living they would have had if they were living with both parents. (3) The Commission shall impute income to assets by multiplying the total net value of the assets by the current 6-month treasury bill rate or any other rate that the Commission determines is reasonable and subtracting the actual income from the assets that were included as gross income. (e) In-Kind Contributions. Only when agreed upon by both parties and the Tribal Court, in-kind contributions may be considered in lieu of cash child support and other non-assignable debts owed to the custodial party. The Court may consider circumstances of the parties including whether a non-custodial party is able obtain employment or has no other financial resources available to meet the current cash child support obligation. (1) In-kind may not be ordered to repay assigned debts owed to a state or tribal jurisdiction. All in-kind orders must describe the type of in-kind contribution and must assign a dollar value to the contribution. (2) Should an in-kind contribution not be met, the recipient of the in-kind is responsible to notify the Tribal Child Support Agency no later than the last day of each month of the non-compliance in writing. If a notice of non-compliance is not received by the last day of the month, it shall be presumed the in-kind contribution was met and the payor shall receive a credit based on the Court Order on the first day of each following month on his/her child support account statement maintained by the Tribal Child Support Agency. (3) Nothing in this section allows a payor of in-kind contributions to exceed the limits on the hunting or gathering of all regulated natural resources including limits and seasons imposed by tribal law. In-kind orders may only apply to the extent permitted under tribal, state and federal laws. (f) If a child is receiving Social Security cash benefits as a result of the natural parent's disability, the amount owed for current support shall be reduced by the amount of the child's monthly cash benefit. Should the child's monthly cash benefit exceed the amount of the monthly child support obligation there shall be no credit against any child support arrears debt. (g) Child support obligations must be based on the percentages contained in Section YAE.09.07(h) and shall be represented as a whole dollar amount or sum certain in the Court Order. (h) The basic child support guideline in this section shall be utilized when one party has primary placement of a child(ren). Child support is reduced to a whole dollar amount by multiplying the payor's or serial parent gross income by the number of children in the case as follows: (1) 17% for one child (2) 25% for two children (3) 29% for three children (4) 31% for four children (5) 34% for five or more children (i) If a payor has more than one child support case, the amount of the prior child support order or duty to support shall be deducted from his or her gross income and then multiplied by the percentages in (H) above. (j) Non-marital children cases are determined by the child support order date and the legal obligation for marital children will begin on the child's date of birth. (k) Child support arrears may be ordered by the Tribal Court dating back to the date of application or referral received by the Tribal Child Support Agency or the date of filing of the action if the Tribal Child Support Agency is not involved in the action.

The Court may order any of the enforcement actions the Agency is authorized to implement. In addition, the Court may order the following to enforce a child support order: (1) Bonds and Other Guarantees.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section YAE.10.01 \u2014 Purpose, Findings, And Scope (a) Purpose: In general, the Tribe must adhere to federal law and state law by conducting criminal background checks on employees and volunteers who work with youth. The purpose of this Ordinance is to meet the specific needs of the Community and adhere to the applicable state and federal laws. (b) Tribal Council Findings: (1) Tribal Council recognizes that elders and youth are vulnerable members of the Community who should not be placed at risk by being placed in the care of persons who may have a propensity to harm elders/youth. Tribal Council finds that in the interest of ensuring that elders/youth utilizing tribal services are not exposed to individuals who have a propensity to harm elders/youth, an individual desiring a position with elders/youth is subject to a background investigation and must obtain an elder/youth license. (2) Tribal Council also recognizes the importance of optimal employment opportunities to the Community. Tribal Council finds that if an applicant is unable to obtain an elder/youth license, the applicant should not automatically be denied other employment within the same facility, or for other positions within the Tribe. Tribal Council recognizes that specific employment duties for one position may require an elder/youth license while another position within the same facility may not require a license. (c) Scope: This Ordinance applies to all Tribal employment positions, service contracts, and volunteer positions that have regular contact or control over elders/youth, and to boards and committees whose responsibilities and duties provide access to elders/youth. In general, the Ella Besaw Center, the Health Center, the Day Care Center, Head Start, and the Family Center are within the scope of licensing. However, this Ordinance is intended to include other Tribal departments, agencies, entities, or persons if they have regular contact or control over elders/youth, or if other Tribal/federal/state laws are applicable.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section YAE.10.10 \u2014 Appeal Rights And Limited Waiver Of Sovereign Immunity (a) Notwithstanding Chapter TCT.02 of the Tribal Ordinances, the Tribal Court has jurisdiction to review Human Resources Final Determination if an applicant has been denied an elder/youth license, if the applicant has not waived their right to appeal by failing to respond after the Preliminary Determination.

(1) Because the licensing determination is very fact specific, is performed by a Tribal department that regularly makes Human Resource/employment decisions, and Tribal Council has determined that elders/youth are in need of protection, the Tribal Court's review of the license determination will be restricted to the following: (A) The Court will not remand a Human Resource's Final Determination unless, (i) Human Resources made a plain error in the process of making of making its Final Determination, or, (ii) The determination to deny a license was so unreasonable that a reasonable person could not have made a similar determination. (2) The applicant's sole remedy is to remand the Final Determination to Human Resources for reconsideration of the Final Determination. (e) Standing: Only the applicant (or their attorney) has standing to request that the Tribal Court review the Final Determination. (f) The waiver provided in this Ordinance is granted only for suits in the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court. The Stockbridge-Munsee Community does not waive its immunity from suit to any suits brought in any court other than the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Tribal Court.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section DMR.02.08 \u2014 Custody And Physical Placement (a) In rendering a judgment of divorce the court shall make such provisions as it deems just and reasonable concerning the legal custody and physical placement of any minor child of the parties, as provided in this section. (b) (1) Subject to subsection (2) , based on the best interest of the child and after considering the factors under subsection (e), the court may give joint legal custody or sole legal custody of a minor child. (2) The court may give joint legal custody only if it finds that doing so is in the child's best interest and that either of the following applies: (A) Both parties agree to joint legal custody; (B) The parties do not agree to joint legal custody, but one party requests joint legal custody and the court specifically finds all of the following: (i) Both parties are capable of performing parental duties and responsibilities and wish to have an active role in raising the child; (ii) No conditions exist at that time which would substantially interfere with the exercise of joint legal custody; (iii) The parties will be able to cooperate in the future decision making required under an award of joint legal custody. In making this finding the court shall consider, along with any other pertinent items, any reasons offered by a party objecting to joint legal custody. Evidence that either party engaged in abuse of the child or evidence of inter-spousal battery creates a rebuttable presumption that the parties will not be able to cooperate. This presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the abuse will not interfere with the parties' ability to cooperate in the future decision making required. (c) (1) Except as provided under subsection (2) , if the court orders sole or joint legal custody under subsection (b) , the court shall allocate periods of physical placement between the parties in accordance with this section. In determining the allocation of periods of physical placement, the court shall consider each case on the basis of the factors listed in subsection (d) . (2) A child is entitled to periods of physical placement with both parents unless, after a hearing, the court finds that physical placement with a parent would endanger the child's physical, mental or emotional health. (3) No court may deny periods of physical placement for failure to meet, or grant periods of physical placement for meeting, any financial obligation to the child or the former spouse. (d) In determining legal custody and periods of physical placement, the court shall consider all facts relevant to the best interest of the child. The court may not prefer one potential custodian over the other on the basis of the sex or race of the custodian. The court shall consider reports of appropriate professionals if admitted into evidence when legal custody or physical placement is contested. The court shall consider the following factors in making its determination: (1) The wishes of the child's parent or parents; (2) The wishes of the child, which may be communicated by the child or through the child's guardian ad litem or other appropriate professional; (3) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or her parent or parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interest; (4) The child's adjustment to the home, school, religion and community; (5) The mental and physical health of the parties, the minor children and other persons living in a proposed custodial household; (6) The availability of public or private child care services; (7) Whether one party is likely to unreasonably interfere with the child's continuing relationship with the other party; (8) Whether there is evidence that a party engaged in abuse of the child; (9) Whether there is evidence of inter-spousal battery; (10) Whether either party has or had a significant problem with alcohol or drug abuse. (11) Such other factors as the court may in each individual case determine to be relevant. (e) (1) If legal custody or physical placement is contested, the court shall state in writing why its findings relating to legal custody or physical placement are in the best interest of the child. (2) The court may give one party sole power to make specified decisions, while both parties retain equal rights and responsibilities for other decisions. (3) In making an order of joint legal custody and periods of physical placement, the court may specify one parent as the primary caretaker of the child and one home as the primary home of the child, for the purpose of determining eligibility for aid under any financial assistance program or for any other purpose the court considers appropriate. (4) No party awarded joint legal custody may take any action inconsistent with any applicable physical placement order, unless the court expressly authorizes that action. (5) In an order for physical placement, the court shall specify the right of each party to the physical control of the child in sufficient detail to enable a party deprived of that control to implement any law providing relief for interference with custody or parental rights.

(A) Within 2 years after initial order. Except as provided under sub. (2), a court may not modify any of the following orders before 2 years after the initial order is entered, unless a party seeking the modification, upon petition, motion, or order to show cause shows by substantial evidence that the modification is necessary because the current custodial conditions are physically or emotionally harmful to the best interest of the child: (i) An order of legal custody; (ii) An order of physical placement if the modification would substantially alter the time a parent may spend with his or her child. (B) After 2\u2013year period. (i) Except as provided under par. (A) and sub. (2), upon petition, motion or order to show cause by a party, a court may modify an order of legal custody or an order of physical placement where the modification would substantially alter the time a parent may spend with his or her child if the court finds all of the following: (I) The modification is in the best interest of the child; (II) There has been a substantial change of circumstances since the entry of the last order affecting legal custody or the last order substantially affecting physical placement. (ii) With respect to sub. (a)(1)(B)(i), there is a rebuttable presumption that: (I) Continuing the current allocation of decision making under a legal custody order is in the best interest of the child; (II) Continuing the child's physical placement with the parent with whom the child resides for the greater period of time is in the best interest of the child. (III) A change in the economic circumstances or marital status of either party is not sufficient to meet the standards for modification under sub. (1). (2) Modification of substantially equal physical placement orders. Notwithstanding sub. (1): (A) If the parties have substantially equal periods of physical placement pursuant to a court order and circumstances make it impractical for the parties to continue to have substantially equal physical placement, a court, upon petition, motion or order to show cause by a party, may modify such an order if it is in the best interest of the child. (B) In any case in which par. (A) does not apply and in which the parties have substantially equal periods of physical placement pursuant to a court order, a court, upon petition, motion or order to show cause of a party, may modify such an order based on the appropriate standard under sub. (1). However, under sub. (1) (B) 2, there is a rebuttable presumption that having substantially equal periods of physical placement is in the best interest of the child. (3) Modification of other physical placement orders. Except as provided under subs. (1) and (2), upon petition, motion or order to show cause by a party, a court may modify an order of physical placement which does not substantially alter the amount of time a parent may spend with his or her child if the court finds that the modification is in the best interest of the child. (4) Denial of physical placement. Upon petition, motion or order to show cause by a party or on its own motion, a court may deny a parent's physical placement rights at any time if it finds that the physical placement rights would endanger the child's physical, mental or emotional health. (5) Reasons for modification. If either party opposes modification or termination of a legal custody or physical placement order under this section the court shall state, in writing, its reasons for the modification or termination. (6) Notice. No court may enter an order for modification under this section until notice of the petition, motion or order to show cause requesting modification has been given to the child's parents, if they can be found, and to any relative or agency having custody of the child. (7) Transfer to department. The court may order custody transferred to the Tribal Social Services only if that department agrees to accept custody.

(1) The insurer shall conduct an initial investigation promptly, so that a preliminary decision is made as to whether the worker shall receive compensation. In claims where compensation is payable, the insurer shall make the first payment thereof within 14 days after receipt of the claim. This preliminary decision is not a binding determination of any obligations for compensation.

(2) If a worker obtains a written statement indicating the employer's prior approval of treatments by a non-designated provider, such medical services are covered under this Ordinance. (3) If a worker is dissatisfied with the medical care offered by the designated providers, the worker shall submit a written statement to the employer indicating this dissatisfaction and the reasons for it. (A) Based on this statement, the worker and employer may agree that a worker shall be permitted to seek alternative treatments or care providers. (B) If the worker and the employer cannot agree as to alternative care, the worker may receive a second opinion by a care provider of the worker's choice. (C) The worker must receive the employer's prior approval before receiving any treatments from the care provider chosen by worker. If prior approval is not obtained, the employer is not responsible for any expense except the initial evaluation. (D) Other care providers used by the worker may confer with and obtain information on the worker's condition from the employer-retained physician. (b) Reasonable Examination. Whenever a worker makes a claim for compensation, the worker shall submit to reasonable, additional examinations by physicians, chiropractors, psychologists, podiatrists, or vocational experts that are provided and paid for by the employer or insurer upon written request of that party. (1) An employer or insurer who requests such an examination shall pay the worker all necessary expenses, including transportation expenses. (2) The worker is entitled to have a doctor that is selected by and paid by the worker present at the examination. The worker may also request and receive a copy of all reports of the examination. (3) Independent Medical Examination. (A) If either party disagrees with the treating provider's determination as the worker's level of disability for the purposes of compensation, an independent medical examination (\"IME\") can be requested. (B) The IME will be provided by an independent provider, such as through Medical Evaluations, Inc., and will be paid for by the insurer. (C) If the disability rating from the IME differs from the one from the treating provider, the two ratings shall be averaged and the compensation shall be based on this average. (c) Refusal. If the worker, after a written request of the employer or insurer, refuses to submit to or in any way obstructs medical examinations, treatment, or rehabilitation (other than surgery that may endanger life or limb), the worker's right to begin or maintain any proceeding to receive worker's compensation is suspended, unless it is shown that the request is unreasonable.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section EMP.04.18 \u2014 Disability Benefits (a) Definitions. As used in this Ordinance: (1) \"Temporary disability\" occurs during the healing period for an injury. \"Temporary disability benefits\" is the compensation a worker receives for wage loss that occurs during this healing period. (A) A worker can receive temporary total disability benefits when there is complete wage loss. (B) A worker can receive temporary partial disability benefits when there is a partial wage loss. (2) \"Permanent disability\" occurs when a worker has permanent effects from an injury at the end of the healing period for that injury. \"Permanent disability benefits\" is the compensation a worker receives for these permanent effects and is compensation for future losses of earnings, theoretically. (A) A worker can receive permanent total disability benefits when they have total physical impairment for industrial use of both eyes, or the loss of both arms at or near the shoulder, or of both legs at or near the hip, or of one arm at the shoulder and one leg at the hip, or in other circumstances as appropriate. (B) A worker receives permanent partial disability benefits when he or she suffers permanent effects less than total impairment. (b) Rates. Compensation rates are based on a worker's \"average weekly wage,\" which is the wage rate in effect at the time of the injury. The average weekly wage is used to calculate the worker's wage loss and applicable disability benefits. (1) The compensation rates for disability benefits are subject to the maximum and minimum limits as described in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 102.11(1) and its periodic updates. (2) The average weekly wage is calculated based on a worker's daily earnings at the time of the injury. The daily earnings are multiplied by the number of days and fractional days normally worked per week. For a complete description of how to calculate the average weekly wage and calculating the wage in special situations, see Wis. Stat. \u00a7 102.11(1)(a) to (g) . (3) The average annual earnings for this Ordinance shall consist of fifty (50) times the worker's average weekly wage. (c) Compensation. Benefits shall be due starting after the third day of disability, excluding Sundays unless the employee regularly works Sundays. If the disability exists beyond 7 days, the employee may receive benefits for the first 3 days. (1) Temporary Total Disability. If the injury causes temporary total disability, the worker shall receive temporary total disability benefits. These benefits are two-thirds of the average weekly wage, subject to the maximum and minimum amounts discussed above in subsection (b)(1) of this Section. (A) There is no limitation on the number of weeks that a worker can receive temporary disability benefits, unless limited elsewhere in this Ordinance. (B) The worker may be eligible for supplemental benefits of up to $233, as described in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 102.44(1) , if on continuous temporary total disability for 24 months. (C) Temporary total disability benefits shall end on the date the worker: (i) is released for full-duty work by a health care practitioner; or (ii) is given a limited release to return to light-duty work and the employer can accommodate the restrictions (the limitations in subsections (c)(2)(C) and (c)(2)(D) of this Section shall apply in relation to the worker's temporary total disability benefits); or (iii) has reached the maximum medical improvement for the injury. (2) Temporary Partial Disability. If the injury causes temporary partial disability, the worker shall receive such proportion of temporary total disability benefits as the actual wage loss of the worker bears to the worker's average weekly wage at the time of the injury. (A) Benefits are subject to the maximum and minimum amounts discussed in subsection (b)(1) of this Section. (B) There is no limitation on the number of weeks that a worker can receive temporary disability benefits. (C) A worker may be given a limited release to return to work by a health care practitioner during a period of temporary partial disability. (i) An employer is not required to make light-duty work available while a worker is on a limited release. If the employer chooses to do so, the worker shall be notified that the light-duty position is temporary. (ii) If the employer provides light-duty work at a lower wage than the worker's normal wage at the time of the injury, the worker is entitled to temporary partial disability benefits proportional to the wage loss. (iii) If the worker refuses the offer of light-duty work, the worker is only entitled to temporary partial disability benefits based on the proportional wage loss as discussed in subsection (c)(2)(C)(ii) above. (D) If the worker does not inform the employer of a limited release for work, the worker loses eligibility for continuing temporary disability benefits, even if the worker does not expect light-duty work to be offered. This does not apply if the health care practitioner only informs the employer of the limited release. (E) Temporary partial disability benefits shall end on the date the worker is released for full-duty work by a health care practitioner or has reached the maximum medical improvement for the injury. (3) If, at the end of the healing period, a doctor determines that the worker has permanent effects from the injury that impact the ability to work, the worker may receive permanent disability benefits. (4) Permanent Total Disability. If there is total physical impairment, the permanent total disability benefit rate is the same as that for temporary total disability or two-thirds of the average weekly wage, subject to the maximum and minimum amounts discussed above in subsection (b)(1) of this Section. (A) The worker may be eligible for a supplemental benefit to the permanent total disability benefit of up to $233 per week. Eligibility for and amount of such a supplemental benefit is described in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 102.44(1) . (B) A worker on permanent total disability is eligible for benefits for the rest of his or her life. The worker's dependents will be eligible for a death benefit, regardless of cause of death, unless the worker has exceeded his or her lifetime disability benefits of 1000 weeks of total disability. (5) Permanent Partial Disability. If the permanent effects result in less than total impairment, permanent partial disability benefits are paid at the rate of two-thirds of the average weekly wage for the period provided in the permanent partial disability schedule. These amounts are subject to the maximum and minimum amounts discussed above in subsection (b)(1) of this Section. (A) The permanent partial disability schedule sets out the number of weeks that a worker receives further benefits at the end of the healing period. The time periods in the schedule vary depending on the location and degree of the permanent effects. The schedule can be found in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 102.52 . The application of the permanent partial disability schedule is discussed in Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 102.53 to 102.56 . (B) For permanent partial disabilities not covered by the permanent partial disability schedule, such as those to the head and torso, the number of weeks of compensation shall bear such relation to 1,000 weeks as the injury bears to one causing permanent total disability. During this period (not to exceed 1,000 weeks), compensation shall be paid at the rate of two-thirds of the average weekly wage. (C) When calculating permanent partial disability, in no case shall the compensation be greater than 100% of permanent total disability. (6) Mental Injury. Benefits for mental injuries shall be paid for a maximum of two (2) years at the rate of two-thirds of the average weekly wage, subject to the maximum and minimum amounts discussed above in subsection (b)(1) of this Section. (7) Death. (A) Where death proximately results from the injury and the deceased leaves a person wholly dependent for support, the death benefit shall equal 4 times his or her average annual earnings, but when added to the disability indemnity paid and due at the time of death, shall not exceed two-thirds of the weekly wage for the scheduled number of weeks. This benefit shall be paid to those persons wholly dependent for support as determined by the ALJ. (B) If death occurs, other than as a proximate result of the injury before disability compensation ends, death benefits and burial expense shall be allowed as followed: (i) if the injury proximately caused permanent total disability, the injury shall be treated as if it had caused death, or (ii) if the injury caused permanent partial disability, the remaining compensation shall be applied toward funeral expenses and any remaining sum paid to persons wholly dependent for support. (C) However, if the worker is not survived by any persons wholly dependent for support, those persons who were partially dependent on the deceased worker for support may receive such benefits as ordered by the ALJ. (8) If the disability period involves a fractional week, compensation shall be paid for each day of such week, except Sundays only, at the rate of one-sixth of the weekly compensation. (d) Burial Expenses. In cases where death of the worker proximately results from the injury, reasonable burial expenses shall be paid, not exceeding $6,000.00.

Stat. \u00a7 102.44(5) .

Stat. \u00a7 102.44(6) . The worker is required to make a diligent effort to find employment. (c) Compensation will be denied, if the injury results from the worker's: (1) failure to use safety devices that have been provided by the employer, which the worker has notice of and does not have a valid reason or a medical excuse for not using the safety devices, (2) failure to obey any reasonable rule adopted and reasonably enforced by the employer for the safety of workers and of which the worker has notice and does not have a valid reason or a medical excuse for not following the rule; or (3) misconduct, including use of alcohol or controlled substances.

GENERAL PROBATE PROVISIONS This Part begins by setting out the purpose and philosophy of this Probate Code. Section 6.1.1 provides that the code should be liberally interpreted to meet the following objections: (A) To ensure that the property of decedents passes to the rightful heirs or beneficiaries. (B) To comply with the decedent's wishes as much as possible. (C) To comply with tribal custom and tradition. (D) To provide a simple, efficient and inexpensive method for probate decedent's property. (E) To prevent the transfer of land our of tribal ownership and control. (F) To ensure that the rights of creditors of decedents are protected to the extent possible and fair. (G) To promote and further the Tribe's inherent right to self-governance. It is very useful to begin a probate code by getting forth the purpose and philosophy to guide the court in interpreting and applying the code. The Tribal Council should carefully review these objectives to determine whether these objectives are appropriate and consistent with the needs of the community. Section 6.1.2 sets forth a long series of specific definitions due to the fact that probate law in general and Indian probate law specifically has a unique language which often needs explanation. Section 6.1.3 provides for a broad statement of jurisdiction. It provides for the exercise of the greatest possible tribal jurisdiction over the probate of the estate of decedents who were domiciled or owned real or personal property on the Indian Reservation. Jurisdiction is not limited to Indian decedents or to tribal members. Instead, it allows the court to assert probate jurisdiction over anyone who was domiciled or owned real or personal property on the reservation. It does not mean that the court must assert jurisdiction in all of the potential cases - but it does give the court flexibility to assert jurisdiction when it is appropriate. Sections 6.1.4 and 6.1.5 allow for the use of tribal custom and tradition. Section 6.1.4 is important because it allows anyone to renounce any property or interest and sets forth the procedure for renunciation of succession. The remaining sections are standard general probate provisions as follows: Section 6.1.6 - Allows relief when fraud is involved Section 6.1.7 - Provides procedure for determining evidence of death Section 6.1.8 - Allows for use of civil procedure and appellate review when appropriate Section 6.1.9 - Sets forth judicial powers and duties Section 6.1.10 - Sets out rules for records and copies Section 6.1.11 - Allows for trials to the court", "num": "PRP.04", "path": "library|Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code|PRP|PRP.04", "title": "Chapter PRP.04 \u2014 Probate Code", "url": "/us/nsn/mohican/council/code/PRP.04"}

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section PRP.04.01 \u2014 Purpose (a) The following title shall hereinafter be referred to as the Probate Code. The objective of the Probate Code is to provide for the exercise of the greatest possible tribal jurisdiction over the probate of the estate of decedents who were domiciled or owned real or personal property on the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Indian Reservation. The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Council finds that probate procedure in the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court is in the best interest of tribal members in that probate may be concluded more economically and more expeditiously than by other jurisdictions. Furthermore, the determination of how property is disposed upon a person's death is an exercise of self-governance crucial to tribal sovereignty. (b) This code shall be liberally construed and applied to meet the following objectives: (1) To ensure that the property of decedents passes to the rightful heirs or beneficiaries. (2) To comply with the decedent's wishes as much as possible. (3) To comply with tribal custom and tradition. (4) To provide a simple, efficient and inexpensive method for probating decedent's property. (5) To prevent the transfer of land out of tribal ownership and control. (6) To ensure that the rights of creditors of decedents are protected to the extent possible and fair. (7) To promote and further the tribe's inherent right to self-governance.

A will is construed to pass all property which the testator owns at their death including property acquired after the execution of their will; (2) Devisee must survive testator by 120 hours. A devisee who does not survive the testator by 120 hours is treated as if they predeceased the testator, unless the will of the decedent contains such language dealing explicitly with simultaneous deaths, including common disaster, or requiring that the devisee survive the testator or survive the testator for a stated period in order to take under the will; (3) Failure of testamentary provision. If a devise other than a residuary devise fails for any reason, it becomes part of the residual estate. If the residual estate is devised to two or more persons and the share of one of the residuary devisees fails for any reason, their share passes to the other residuary devisees, or to other residuary devisees in proportion to their interests in the residue. (4) Class Gifts. One who would have been a devisee under a class gift if they had survived the testator is treated as a devisee for purposes of this section whether their death occurred before of after the execution of the will; (5) Exercise of power of appointment. A general residuary clause in a will, or a will making general disposition of all the testator's property, does not exercise a power of appointment unless specific reference is made to that power; (6) Generic Terms. Half-bloods, adopted persons and persons born out of wedlock are included in class gifts terminology and terms of relationships in accordance with rules for determining relationships for purposes of intestate succession, but a person born out of wedlock is not treated as the child of the father unless the person is openly and notoriously so treated by the father or unless paternity has been judicially determined during the life of the father or in some other manner which satisfies the court by clear and convincing evidence that paternity has been conclusively established. (7) Ademption by satisfaction. Property which a testator gave in their lifetime to a person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise to that person in whole or in part, only if the will provides for deduction of the lifetime gift, or the testator declares in a contemporaneous writing that the gift is to be deducted from the devise or is in satisfaction. For the purpose of partial satisfaction, property given during the lifetime is valued as of the time the devisee came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of death of the testator, whichever occurs first.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section PRP.04.78 \u2014 Definition Of Guardian (a) A guardian is an adult appointed to take care of the person or property of another. The guardian must exercise the highest standard of care for the ward, and is subject to regulation by the Tribal Court. (b) The Court, when it appears necessary or convenient, may appoint guardians for the persons and/or property of either children under the Court's jurisdiction or incompetents who have no guardian legally appointed by will or deed. Such appointment may be made on the petition of a relative or other person on behalf of the child or incompetent, or a petition of the child if at least fourteen (14) years of age. Before making such appointment, the Court must cause such notice as the Court deems reasonable to be given to any person having the care of a child, and to such other relatives of a child residing on the reservation as the Court may deem proper, and in cases of adult incompetents, the Court may cause notice to be given to the incompetent at least five (5) days before hearing the petition. (c) If a child is under the age of fourteen (14) years, the Court may nominate or appoint their guardian. If the child is fourteen (14) years of age or older, the child may nominate their own guardian who, if approved by the Court, must be appointed accordingly. If the guardian nominated by the child is not approved by the Court, or if the child resides outside of the reservation, or if, after being duly cited by the Court, the child neglects for ten (10) days to nominate a suitable person, the Court may nominate and appoint the guardian in the same manner as if the child were under the age of fourteen (14) years. (d) When a guardian has been appointed by the Court for a child under the age of fourteen (14) years, the child, at any time after the child attains that age, may nominate their own guardian, subject to the approval of the Court. A guardian appointed may as specified by the Court have the custody and care of the education of the child and the care and management of their property until such child arrives at the age of eighteen (18), marries, is emancipated by the Court, or until the guardian is legally discharged, provided, however, that said guardian shall not have the authority, without express written consent of the Court, to dispose of any real or personal property of the child in any manner, including, but not limited to, the child's Individual Indian Money Account and any trust fund account. With respect to a child's trust fund account, the guardian shall be bound by this code and any requirements and provisions of the Tribe's Revenue Allocation Plan. Said guardian shall also have the authority to consent to the medical care and treatment of the child. (e) The Court may order that the Court disburse monthly reimbursement payments to the person or agency to whom custody is granted under this code, provided sufficient funds have been appropriated by the Tribal council. Said disbursements must be used by the person or agency with custody of the child for the sole purpose of covering expenses incurred in the care and custody of said child and shall not be used for any other purpose. The use of said funds for any purpose other than that described in this section shall subject said person or agency to contempt of Court and to any criminal and civil penalties or remedies provided by the Tribal code.

(2) The landlord has failed or refused to make repairs which are his responsibility after a reasonable demand by a tenant to do so, without good cause, and the repairs are necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the premises. (3) There are monies due and owing to the tenant because he has been required to make repairs which are the obligation of the landlord, and the landlord has failed or refused to make them after a reasonable notice. Such sums may be a complete or partial defense to a complaint for eviction, but only to the extent that such sums set off monies owed for occupancy. A tenant may be evicted after such a period if he fails or refuses to pay the reasonable rental value of the premises. (4) Due to the conduct of the landlord, there is injury to the tenant in such a way that justice requires that relief be modified or denied. This shall include the equitable defenses of estoppel, laches, fraud, misrepresentation, and breaches of serious and material obligations for public health, safety, and peace standards. (5) There are such serious and material breaches of applicable housing law on the part of the landlord that it would be unjust to grant him a remedy. (6) The landlord is evicting the tenant because of his/her race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, age, marital status, family status, or because the tenant is disabled. (7) There are any other material or relevant fact, which the tenant might present, that may explain why his eviction is unjust and unfair. (b) No defense may be founded upon either of the grounds listed in (a)(1) or (a)(2 unless: (1) the obligation to maintain or repair is that of the landlord under this Ordinance or the agreement of the parties, and a clear and reasonable demand was made by the tenant to correct such conditions or the landlord knew of them; and (2) the landlord has had a reasonable opportunity to maintain or make repairs and the tenant has been cooperative in allowing them.

Box 70, Bowler, WI 54416 and __________________________________________________, (\"Lessee(s)\"), of _______________, Wisconsin, whose mailing address upon completion of improvements to be financed with the loan referred to herein will be ____________________________________ __________________________. 1. Description of Property. The Lessor hereby leases to the Lessee the following described property, located in Shawano County, State of Wisconsin: together with all buildings and improvements thereon not already belonging to Lessee and all rights thereto appertaining. 2. Term of Lease. The term of this Lease shall be __________ years (not to exceed twenty-five years) from the date of the closing of a loan with a federal lending agency or a private lender (\"Lender\"), provided the date is within one year from the date of Secretarial approval of this Lease. If a loan made or guaranteed by a Lender is outstanding at the expiration of the lease term, then this Lease shall automatically be extended for a period of ___________ years (time sufficient to cover the loan period).

The effective beginning date of this Lease shall be noted in this Lease by attachment of a copy of the promissory note which by reference is made a part hereof. If a loan is not closed within the one year, this Lease will not take effect and will be null and void . 3. Rental Rate. The Lessee will pay annually to the Treasurer of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Council an annual sum for the rent of the leased premises in the amount of $__________, said rent to be paid prior to delivery of this Lease to the said Lessee and on or before each anniversary date thereafter, unless said rent shall exceed $__________ in which case said rent shall be paid in ______ equal installments. The amount of the rent will be reviewed at five (5) year intervals by the Lessor for purposes of determining if the rent is fair, equitable and reasonable based on economic conditions of the Lessor and the Lessee. Adjustments in rent must have prior written approval of Lender. It is understood and agreed between the parties hereto that, if any installment of rental is not paid within thirty (30) days after becoming due, interest at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum will become due and will run until said rent is paid. Lessor shall provide Lessee of notice of default within the thirty (30) day period. 4. Conditions: A. It is mutually agreed by the Lessor and the Lessee that the express purpose of this Lease is to enable the Lessee to obtain a loan from a federal agency agreed upon by the Lessee or from a private lender for renovation, new construction or purchase of a home. B. The Lessor, in consideration of the granting of such loan by the Mortgagee to the Lessee, hereby consents thereto and grants permission to the Lessee to execute and deliver to the Mortgagee a Real Estate Mortgage covering the Lessee's leasehold interest in and to the property above described including improvements now existing thereon or which may be constructed thereon. C. The Lessor agrees that this Lease may not be terminated for any reason without the written consent of the Mortgagee as long as any of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage remains unpaid. This provision shall apply to any attempted termination by surrender of the leasehold interest. Upon the Lessor obtaining the Mortgagee's consent or after termination of the Mortgagee's interest in the leased premises, the Lessee agrees that if the Lessee shall fail to comply with, or shall violate any of the provisions of this Lease, the Lessor or his authorized representative may declare the Lease forfeited after giving sixty (60) days written notice, and may thereupon take such action to repossess the premises and such other action as may be necessary to protect the interest of the Lessor as provided for by law, but such forfeiture shall not release the Lessee from paying all rents and other obligations contracted for or from damages for such failure or violation; PROVIDED, however, that in the event of such declared forfeiture, the Lessee's liability for rent contracted for shall extend only for the duration of that particular annual rental period for which said Lessee, pursuant to the provisions stated herein, would have paid in advance and not for the entire unexpired term of said Lease, whatever said unexpired term may be at the time of said declared forfeiture. After the termination of the Mortgagee's interest in the leased premises, this Lease may be terminated upon the failure of the Tenant to comply with any of the provisions of this Lease. D. Lessee understands and agrees that any and all use rights heretofore held by Lessee(s) in the premises, are extinguished through the signing of this Lease and that the Lessee shall hereafter hold rights only by virtue of this Lease. E. Upon expiration of this Lease, or upon its termination in accordance with terms hereof, unless such termination is due to default upon the part of the Lessee(s), Lessee(s) or any successors in interest shall be entitled to full enjoyment of the premises and Lessee(s) shall have the right to reassume their land assignment and all rights thereunder. If not so eligible, Lessee(s) and any successors in interest shall, upon demand, surrender to Lessor upon expiration or other termination of this Lease complete and peaceable possession of the premises and any or all improvements thereon, which shall be the property of the Tribe. Personal property shall remain the Lessee's property. Lessee hereby agrees that in the event this Lease is not renewed or extended and the land assignment is not reassumed, the Lessee shall have the right to remove the improvements placed on the leased premises with the loan obtained under section 4(a) within thirty (30) days of the said termination date. In the event the Lessee removes said improvements, Lessee shall be responsible for the costs of renovation of the premises, which renovation shall include removal of foundations, sanitary septic systems, sidewalks, fences, and the filling, leveling and seeding of the ground to restore the original condition as may be determined in writing by the Lessor as being in the best interests of the Lessor. At Lessor's option, a bond may be required to assure compliance with such restorations prior to the removal of improvements in an amount sufficient to assure such restoration. F. The Lessee will keep the buildings, fences and other improvements on the premises in good repair and condition, excepting ordinary wear and tear, loss by fire, or unavoidable depreciation for destruction. The Lessee shall properly conceal all legal refuse areas. The Lessee shall be responsible for construction and maintaining all improvements which may be required by applicable law and Lessee shall indemnify and save harmless the Lessor against all action, claims and damages by reason of the Lessee's failure to keep and maintain said premises and the improvements thereon as provided hereinabove or by reason of Lessee's non-observance of any applicable laws, ordinances or regulations. The Lessor shall not be liable for any loss, damage or injury of any kind whatsoever to the person or property of the Lessee or sublessee or any of the Lessee's or sublessee's employees, guests, or invitees, or of any other person whatsoever, caused by any use of the leased premises, or by any defect in any building, structure, or other improvement erected thereon, or arising from any accident on said premises or any fire or other casualty thereon, or occasioned by the failure on the part of the Lessee's or sublessee's employees, guests, or invitee or arising from any other cause whatsoever; and the Lessees, as a material part of the consideration of this Lease, hereby waives, on Lessee's behalf, all claims and demands against the Lessor and agrees to indemnify and save Lessor free and harmless from liability for all claims and demands for any such loss, damage, or injury, together with all costs and expenses arising therefrom and in connection therewith. G. If the Lessor shall sell or otherwise transfer title to the premises, he will do so subject to the provision of this Lease. H. The terms of this Lease shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, and administrators, and successors and assigns of both Lessor and Lessee in like manner as upon the original parties. I. The Lessor warrants that he has the right to lease the premises and will defend the Lessee's possession against any and all persons whomsoever. J. No member of, or delegate to Congress shall be admitted to any share or part of this contract or to any benefit that may arise here from, but this provision shall not be construed to extend to this contract if made with a corporation or company for its general benefit. K. The Lessee agrees that he will not use or cause to be used any part of said premises for any unlawful purpose. L. The Lessee or his successors in interest shall pay, if any, if and when the same become due and payable, all taxes, general and special assessments and other like charges including any and all license fees or charges properly assessed which may be levied, assessed or imposed during the term of this Lease upon or against the leased land and all interest therein and improvements and other property thereon for which either the Lessee or Lessor may become liable in relation thereto and Lessee shall hold harmless the Lessor from any such taxes and claims, or sale or other proceedings to enforce payment thereof. Should Lessee fail to pay any such taxes, liens or claims when due, Lessor may at its option, upon written notice to Lessee, settle or discharge any such taxes, claims, etc., and demand reimbursement by the Lessee together with interest thereon at the current local commercial bank rate. Failure to make such payment within thirty (30) days of Lessor's demand shall constitute a breach of this Lease, and the Lessor may declare this Lease immediately ended with Lessee forfeiting the rent paid for that year, subject to the nontermination provision of section 4(C) and subject to the appeal procedures in 25 C.F.R.

N. It is understood and agreed that this lease, or any amendment thereto, or encumbrance thereunder shall be valid only after approval by the Secretary of Interior or his authorized representative, delegate or successor. Approval of this Lease will not constitute an approval of a mortgage secured in the loan from or guaranteed by Lender. Subsequent mortgages, loans, or other encumbrances require separate approval from the Secretary. No assent, express or implied, to any breach of any of the Lessee's covenants shall be deemed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of any covenants. O. The Lessor shall justly compensate the Lessee for any impairment of Lessee's rights under this Lease or of Lessee's unobstructed use of the leased premises resulting from any condemnation of the land subject to this Lease or from the Lessor's grant of any easement or rights-of-way concerning said land. Lessor shall not voluntarily grant any right of use to the subject premises that would materially interfere with the Lessee's rights to or use of the premises without the written permission of the Lessee and the Mortgagee, if the indebtedness remains outstanding.

Lessee agrees to pay the prevailing fee in Shawano County for a building inspection, if required by the Lessor. Lessor may require that the inspection be done by the Shawano County Building Inspector, however Shawano County shall not have jurisdiction to enforce their codes. Lessor has primary jurisdiction for adoption and enforcing such codes. Lessor may, however, base its codes on Shawano County's codes. The Lessee shall comply with all applicable Federal and Tribal regulations regarding leasing. After the termination of the Mortgagee's interest in the leased premises; the Lessee must obtain the prior approval of the Lessor before any improvements of any kind are constructed on the leased premises. Q. The Lessor and its authorized representatives shall have the right, at any reasonable time during the term of this Lease, to enter upon the leased premises, or any part thereof, to inspect the same and all buildings and other improvements erected and placed thereon. After the termination of the Mortgagee's interest in the leased premises, this Lease or any right to or interest in this Lease or any of the improvements on the leased premises may not be encumbered without the prior written approval of the Lessor, and no such encumbrance shall be valid without said approval. The Lessor reserves the right to require any terms and condition before any encumbrances may be made as to the leased premises as it feels will best protect the Lessor's interest in the leased premises. R. Any notice required by or sent pursuant to any provision of this Lease shall be sufficient if it is sent by first-class certified mail. In the case of the Lessee, to the lessee's last known mailing address stated above and in the case of the Lessor to the Lessor at the Lessor's mailing address stated above. Notice to Mortgagee shall be mailed to address provided to Lessor by Mortgagee or other lender. The Lessee agrees to pay and discharge all reasonable costs, attorney's fees and expenses that shall be made and incurred by the Lessor in enforcing the covenants and agreements of this Lease. S. While the leased premises are in trust or restricted status, all of the Lessee's obligations under this Lease, and the obligation of his sureties, are to the United States as well as to the equitable owner of the land. T. Nothing contained in this Lease shall operate to delay or prevent a termination of Federal trust responsibilities with respect to the land by the issuance of a fee patent or otherwise during the term of the Lease; however, such termination shall not serve to abrogate the Lease. The equitable owners of the land and the Lessee and his surety or sureties shall be notified of any such change in the status of the land. 5. Sovereign Immunity. Lessor acknowledges and agrees that upon the occurrence of a breach of any of its obligations under this Lease, the Lessee and/or any Mortgagee or Lender, or its successors or assigns, may protect and enforce its rights by appropriate judicial proceedings against Lessor to be held exclusively within the courts of the Tribe. Such rights shall include, without limitation, the right to pursue any applicable Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal law to enforce the terms of this Lease. This waiver of immunity is not intended, nor shall it be construed to, by implication or otherwise, waive the immunity of the Tribe from suit in any way to any issue not directly arising under this Lease. 6. Assignment. The Lessee shall not assign the Leasehold Estate without prior written consent of the Lessor. Nothing in the Lease shall prevent the Lessee, with the Lessor's and Secretary's consent, from executing and recording a mortgage, declaration of trust and/or other security instrument as may be necessary or appropriate to obtain financing.

This right of first refusal may be exercised at any time within thirty (30) days of the date of the Lender's written notice to the Lessor of the Lessee's failure to cure the default in accordance with the terms of the Lender's written notice to the Lessor of the Lessee's failure to cure the default in accordance with the terms of the Lender's acceleration notice to the Lessee under the mortgage or other security instrument requiring the Lessor to pay all sums secured by the mortgage, which notice shall be given before the Lender or successor invokes any other remedies provided under the mortgage or by law. This right of first refusal shall be exercised by notice in writing from the Lessor to the Lessee and the Lender. The Lessor's right of first refusal to acquire the Lessee's interest in the Leasehold Estate, such right of first refusal shall be subject to any right the Lessee may have under the mortgage or by law to reinstatement after the acceleration, and right to bring a court action to assert the non-existence of a default or any other defense to acceleration and sale foreclosure. The estate acquired by the Lessor through exercise of the right of first refusal shall not merge with any other estate or title held by the Lessor as long as the Leasehold Estate and/or any improvements on the Leasehold Estate, or any interest therein, are mortgaged or otherwise pledged as security for any loan, and the Leasehold Estate shall remain subject to any valid and subsisting mortgage or other security instrument. 8. Foreclosure.

(b) The fish and wildlife are important cultural resources to the Tribe. (c) The Tribe desires to manage the fish and wildlife for present needs and for future generations. (d) Certain species need protection in order to survive as a species. (e) Properly managed natural resources will provide an excellent environment for natural habitat such as fish, wildlife, natural herbs, wildflowers, and forest resources. (f) The Tribe's ownership of fee land, forest crop fee land, managed forest fee land, and the United States' ownership of federal trust and proclaimed lands for the benefit of the Tribe implicates Tribal, federal, and state law depending on the ownership of the land. (g) The Tribe's increasing land base, home building, economic development, and reforestation efforts necessitate increasing involvement and management of the natural resources by the Conservation/Ecology Departments, the Fish and Wildlife Board and the Tribal Council. (h) All enrolled members of the Tribe shall have a right to share in the beneficial use of the natural resources of the Tribe's trust and fee lands. (i) All individuals with privileges under this ordinance also have a responsibility to be good stewards of the natural resources on the Tribe's trust and fee lands. While tribal members do have a right to share in the bounty from the land, they must do so in a responsible manner that ensures the long-term continuation of healthy and sustainable natural resource populations for the benefit of future generations. This responsibility extends to maintaining a healthy environment for sustaining those fish and wildlife resources as all life is inter-connected. ( August 3, 2021, 042-21 .)

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section ENV.02.23 \u2014 Tribal Timber Sale Bid Policy (a) Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to refine the bidding process for sales of forest products by the Tribe and the BIA. The intent of this Policy is to facilitate the Tribe in obtaining the best possible timber sales, consistent with federal law, while encouraging Tribal loggers to participate in the bidding process in a meaningful manner. (b) Coverage and Scope. (1) This Policy applies to the open market sale of standing timber and the tribal forest enterprise sale of standing timber (except for emergency and small lot tribal forest enterprise sales). (2) Certain federal laws, including 25 C.F.R. Ch. 163, or other contracts and grants may supersede or contain provisions that are inconsistent with this Policy. If the federal law/contract/grant provisions are mandatory, those provisions of the contract/grant contract shall control, and the remaining portions of this Policy shall be adhered to. (3) If the Tribal Council has approved a tribal forest enterprise sale of standing timber, then the Tribe reserves the right to have the BIA negotiate the tribal timber sale directly with the Tribe at appraised rates as per 25 C.F.R. 163.13(c). (4) This Policy does not apply to change orders or change directives, which are added work or services within the general scope of an on-going project. (5) This Policy does not prohibit the Tribe retracting any invitation for bids. (c) Approved Loggers. (1) The Committee shall compile and regularly update a list of Approved Loggers. The Committee shall submit the list of Approved Loggers to Tribal Council by July 1 of every year. (2) The criteria for determining Approved Loggers include the ability to obtain and maintain comprehensive and worker's compensation insurance, ability to obtain and maintain bonding, experience, reliability, previous references, background/portfolio of the enterprise, technical ability, financial ability, applicable certification and/or licenses, proof of ownership of equipment, tax numbers or other factors the Forestry Committee deems important. (3) The Committee reserves the right to remove an enterprise from the Approved Logger's list for non-compliance with tribal law and/or their contract. (4) If the Committee determines that a Tribal Logger is ineligible to be an Approved Logger, the Tribal Loggers must be notified in writing regarding what the specific deficiencies are and/or what must be corrected to gain or maintain status. (d) Tribal Logger Preference. (1) The Committee shall apply preference when an Approved Tribal Logger's submitted bid at least meets the BIA's or Tribe's minimum bid rates. (2) The Approved Tribal Logger's submitted bid is within 10% of the highest submitted bid. (3) An Approved Tribal Logger whose bid is within 10% of the highest submitted bid, shall be required to match the highest submitted bid, with the understanding that the Tribe will rebate the matched amount (with no interest) upon successful completion of the timber sale. (A) The BIA may require that the Approved Tribal Logger, in writing or fax, affirmatively agree to match the highest submitted bid by 3pm, the next business day. (4) For example: Timber Company ABC bids $100,000 Tribal Logger bids #1 $ 92,000 Tribal Logger bids #2 $ 94,000 Tribal Logger bids #3 $ 87,000 Tribal Logger #3 bid is too low to be considered for preference. The bid is below the 10% maximum difference to be considered for the sale. Tribal Logger bid #1 is within the 10% maximum difference. However, Tribal Logger bid #2 is the higher bid between the eligible Tribal Loggers. Therefore, Tribal Logger Bid #1 does not receive the timber sale contract. Tribal Logger bid #2 is the highest preference bid with the 10% maximum difference. #2 would be required to match the $100,000 bid, but will receive a rebate of $6,000 upon the successful completion of the timber sale. Timber Company ABC would not get the timber sale contract because Tribal Logger bid #2 would be awarded the timber sale contract. Because Tribal Logger #2's bid is within 10% of the highest bid (Timber Company ABC), and it would match the $4,000 difference, Timber Company ABC and Tribal Logger #2 are essentially bidding at $100,000. (5) Preference shall not be adhered to if there are no Approved Tribal Loggers' bids within 10% of the highest bid. (6) Although this Policy is intended to aid Tribal Loggers in obtaining timber sales contracts, no legal rights or remedies are created by this Policy. (7) Applicant(s) for Indian preference will be required to provide certification of membership from the Tribe. (8) An applicant seeking preference has the burden to demonstrate that the enterprise is eligible for preference, by providing proof of at least 51% ownership at the time of bid submission. (e) Compliance. (1) The Forestry Department and Committee are bound by this Tribal Timber Bid Sale Policy and shall fully comply with all terms of this Policy. The Forestry Department and Committee shall not divide projects, or take other actions to avoid being subject to this Policy. (2) The Tribe's Legal Department shall review all contracts before the Tribe signs the contract.

(b) \"Best Management Practices\" (BMPs) refers to measures, either managerial or structural, that are determined to be the most effective, practical means of preventing or reducing pollution. (c) \"Community Water Supply Well\" is a public water supply well that serves 15 or more service connections used by year-round residents or regularly serves at least 25 year-round residents. (d) \"Groundwater\" is the water that exists beneath the land surface, but more commonly is the water in an aquifer. (e) \"Non-community Water Supply Wells\" are public water supply wells that do not qualify as community water supplies. Non-community water supply wells are divided into two categories: (1) A non-transient non-community water supply regularly serves at least 25 of the same people over six months per year. (2) A transient non-community water supply serves all other non-community water supply systems. (f) \"Person\" refers to any and all persons and parties, including individuals, corporations, partnerships, other organizations or governmental entities. (g) \"Private Sewage System\" is a sewage treatment and disposal system serving a single structure that has a septic tank and soil absorption field located on the same land parcel as the structure. This term also means an approved alternative sewage system, including a substitute for the septic tank or soil absorption field, a holding tank, a system serving two structures or a system located on a different parcel than the structure. (h) \"Private Well\" is any well that provides water for human consumption and is not considered a public water supply well. (i) \"Privy\" is a building or structure above a buried container or above an unlined excavation used for the deposition of human waste. (j) \"Public Water Supply Well\" provides drinking water for human consumption to 15 or more service connections or to an average of at least 25 individuals daily at least 60 days per year. A public water supply well is either a 'community' or 'non-community' water supply well. (k) \"Recharge Area\" means the areas or features that supply groundwater to a well through the surface infiltration of water. (l) \"Safe Drinking Water Act\" (SDWA) refers to the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300f et seq ., and the regulations adopted under the SDWA. (m) \"Time of Travel\" (TOT) is the distance that groundwater will travel in a specified time. In this Ordinance, it refers to the time that it takes groundwater and potential contaminants to reach a pumping well(s) from an area within the aquifer that is up-gradient from the well(s). (n) \"Wastewater\" means any water carrying waste materials, except clear water wastes, created in and conducted away from residences, industrial establishments and public buildings. (o) \"Well\" means any drillhole or other excavation or opening that is deeper than it is wide and extends more than 10 feet below the ground surface for the purpose of obtaining groundwater. (p) \"Wellhead Protection Area\" (WHPA) is the surface and subsurface area around a well, through which contaminants are reasonably likely to move toward and reach that well within a given time frame.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section ENV.06.07 \u2014 Wellhead Protection -- General (a) Wellhead protection provides communities with a way to safeguard water supplies by controlling land use around wells so as to prevent contaminants from entering groundwater. (b) Wellhead protection programs have the goal of identifying and mitigating potential sources of groundwater contamination. They target protecting groundwater from three main sources of contaminants: the direct introduction of contaminants into the well from improper well casing, road runoff, spills and accidents; microbial contamination such as bacteria and viruses; and chemical contaminants. (c) Lands around a well, which receive protection from possible sources of contamination, are called wellhead protection areas (WHPAs). WHPAs can be all or a portion of land that supplies water to a well and that contaminants are reasonably likely to move through to reach a well over a period of time. (1) WHPAs are determined using geologic and hydrologic criteria, such as the physical characteristics of the aquifer and the effect that pumping has on groundwater movement. (2) The delineation of WHPAs allow resources to be focused on protecting the locations where groundwater is most likely to be polluted.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section ENV.06.08 \u2014 Wellhead Protection Districts (a) WHPAs are divided into different wellhead protection districts. These districts are administrative areas where restrictions are placed on uses of land that can pose a threat of contamination to a well. (1) The Reservation contains two types of wellhead protection districts. (A) Groundwater Protection Overlay District A (\"District A\") (i) The primary recharge area of a well is protected in District A. (ii) The land in District A is subject to stringent use and development restrictions because of its close proximity to wells and the corresponding high threat of contamination. (B) Groundwater Protection Overlay District B (\"District B\") (i) Areas of secondary recharge receive protection in District B. (ii) Land use restrictions within District B are less restrictive because of the longer flow time before reaching the well, the increased opportunity for containment dilution and the increased potential for attenuation. (2) The size of these wellhead protection districts varies depending on the type of well with community water supply wells having the largest districts since they pump a greater volume of water and consequently draw water from a larger recharge area. (b) For community water supply wells at the Tribe's primary housing area, which is located off of Camp 14 Road within Section 16, T.28 N., R. 13 E. of Shawano County: (1) District A is described as those lands that lie within the five (5) year TOT. The 5-year TOT for these wells has been established as encompassing those lands within 2,982 feet of the wells; and (2) District B is those lands beyond the 5-year TOT that lie within the twenty (20) year TOT and are located in a direction which lies from -15 o to -70 o off of true north. The 20-year TOT has been established as extending up to 11,928 feet from the wells, but only encompasses those lands to the south of the West Branch of the Red River. (c) For non-community water supply wells on the Reservation: (1) District A are those lands within a radius of 330 feet from the well; and (2) District B are those lands extending out from District A to be within a total distance of 660 feet from the well. (d) For private wells on the Reservation: (1) District A is the area within a radius of 100 feet from the well. (2) District B are those lands extending out from District A to be within a total distance of 300 feet from the well.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section GMG.01.01 \u2014 Findings, Purposes And Policy (a) Findings. The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Council on behalf of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribe finds that: (1) Tribal regulation and control of gaming activity within the jurisdiction of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribe is essential for the protection of public health and welfare, and the interests of the Tribe and the residents of and visitors to the tribal community, and such other areas as may be used for tribal gaming. (2) The Tribe has the legal authority to license and regulate all gaming activity not specifically prohibited by federal law and which is not, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibited by state law, within the jurisdiction of the Tribe. (3) It is essential that the Tribe regulate gaming in a manner commensurate with applicable federal and tribal law and policy, including any Tribal/State Gaming Compact. (4) Tribal needs include employment opportunities, job and skills training, housing, quality health care, educational opportunities, social services, law and order, public safety and judiciary, infrastructure, and economic diversification. (5) Tribal operation and licensing of gaming activities within the jurisdiction of the Tribe are one means of generating revenue to address the needs of the Tribe. (b) Purposes. The purposes of this Ordinance are to: (1) Regulate, control and license the operation of all gaming within the jurisdiction of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribe. (2) Make clear and explicit that a tribal license to operate a gaming activity, to provide gaming related services or equipment or to work as a key employee is a revocable privilege, not a right or a property interest . (3) Ensure that the operation of tribally regulated gaming will continue as a means of generating tribal revenue. (4) Ensure that tribally regulated gaming is conducted fairly and honestly by both gaming operators and players and that it remains free from corrupt, incompetent, unconscionable and dishonest persons and practices. (5) Promote, strengthen and diversify tribal economic development and self-determination and enhance employment opportunities for its members. (6) Generate revenue to strengthen and improve tribal self-government and the provision of tribal governmental services. (7) Ensure that the tribal gaming laws are strictly and fairly enforced against all persons involved in gaming activities within the jurisdiction of the Tribe. (8) Ensure that the Tribe provides a fair and impartial forum for the resolution of gaming disputes. (c) Tribal Policy of Self-Government. The Tribe is firmly committed to the principle of tribal self-government. Consistent with federal policy, tribal government provides a wide range of public services, including general governmental services, maintenance of peace and good order establishment of educational systems and programs and promotion and regulation of economic activities within the sovereign jurisdiction of the Tribe. (d) Tribal Gaming Policy. The establishment, promotion and operation of gaming is necessary and desirable, provided that such gaming is regulated and controlled by the Tribe pursuant to tribal and federal law and any tribal-state gaming compact entered into pursuant to the IGRA, and that all proceeds of such gaming are used for the benefit of the Tribe as required by the IGRA and tribal law. When operated in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, such gaming will be conducive to the general welfare of all residents in the community where such gaming is conducted.

This Ordinance is enacted pursuant to the inherent sovereign powers of the Tribe and powers expressly delegated to the Tribal Council pursuant to the terms of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Constitution. (b) Application of Federal Policy. In 1970, President Nixon announced the policy of the United States Government to promote self-determination for Indian tribes. At the heart of this policy is a commitment by the federal government to foster and encourage tribal self-government, economic development and self-sufficiency. That commitment was signed into law in 1975 as the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, 88 Stat. 2203, 25 U.S.C. Sections 450-450n. In 1983, President Reagan reaffirmed that commitment in his Indian Policy Statement, encouraged tribes to reduce their dependence on federal funds by generating more of their own revenues and pledged to assist tribes in that endeavor. In 1988 the federal commitment to promote tribal economic development, tribal self-sufficiency and strong tribal government was expressly legislated in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (\"IGRA\"), Public Law 100-497, 102 Stat. 2426, 25 U.S.C. Section 2710, et. seq. (1988), which recognized the inherent sovereign right of tribes to operate and their exclusive right to regulate on Indian lands gaming that is not specifically prohibited by federal law and is conducted within a state that does not, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibit such gaming, and provided a federal statutory basis for operation and regulation of Indian gaming. (c) Stockbridge-Munsee Policy of Self-Government. The Tribe is firmly committed to the principal of tribal self-government. Consistent with federal policy, tribal government provides a wide range of public services, including general governmental services, the maintenance of peace and good order and the promotion and regulation of economic activities within the sovereign jurisdiction of the Tribe.

The Ordinance shall be appropriately inserted in the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code. All Ordinances of the Tribe that pertain to gaming and are in effect as of the effective date of this revised Ordinance are hereby repealed, and all other tribal laws or parts thereof inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance are hereby repealed. Repeal of this Ordinance or any portion thereof shall not have the effect of reviving any prior tribal law heretofore repealed or suspended, unless otherwise stated in this Ordinance.

(2) Words in the present tense include the future and past tenses. (3) Words in the singular number include the plural, and words in the plural number include the singular. (4) Words of the masculine gender or neutral gender include masculine and feminine genders and the neuter. (f) Severability.

The information may be disclosed to appropriate Federal, Tribal, State, local, or foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies when relevant to civil, criminal, or regulatory investigations or prosecutions or when pursuant to a requirement by a tribe or the National Indian Gaming Commission in connection with the issuance, denial, or revocation of a gaming license or investigations of activities while associated with a tribe or a gaming operation. Failure to consent to the disclosures indicated in this notice will result in a tribe's being unable to license you for a primary gaming management official or key employee position. (Emphasis added.) The disclosure of an applicant's social security number (SSN) is voluntary. However, failure to supply a SSN may result in errors in processing the application. (5) Each application for an employee gaming license shall, if required, be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee to be established by the Commission.

(7) If another tribe has previously employed the applicant, the Commission or its agent may request investigative information from the other tribe. (8) The Commission, its employees and agents, and the Tribe, and its employees and agents, shall follow the confidentiality act.

(9) When a primary management official or key employee is employed by the Tribe, a complete application, with all of the information required under this Section GMG.01.15(c) , shall be maintained. (d) Review Procedure for Employee Gaming License Application. Before issuing employee gaming license, the Commission will follow the procedure set forth below: (1) Perform or arrange to have performed the necessary background investigation for each primary gaming management official and key employee as required by this Ordinance. (A) Such investigation shall include contacting each reference provided in the application and taking all appropriate steps to verify the accuracy of information contained in the application. (B) Fingerprints shall be taken by the Compliance Department. (C) Fingerprints will then be forwarded to either the State or to the NIGC for processing through the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Criminal Information Center to determine the applicant's criminal history, if any. (D) The Commission may require asset and liability disclosure for key employees and primary gaming management officials to adequately protect the gaming enterprise and determine the suitability of a particular individual for licensing, license renewal or continued suitability for retaining a license. (2) The Commission, or designated agent thereof, shall create and maintain an investigative report for each background investigation of a primary gaming management official or key employee. The report shall include all of the following information: (A) Steps taken in conducting the investigation; (B) Results obtained; (C) Conclusions reached; and (D) The basis for those conclusions. (3) Make the required reportings, outlined in Section GMG.01.15(k) and (l) , to the NIGC prior to issuing a determination on the findings. (4) Review the person's prior activities, criminal record, if any, reputation, habits, and associations to make a finding concerning the suitability of an individual for licensing. Certain acts or other incidents may pose a bar to obtaining a gaming license as more fully described in Section GMG.01.15(e) . Where the Commission determines that licensing of the person poses a threat to the public interests or to the effective regulation of gaming, or creates or enhances dangers of unsuitable, unfair or illegal practices and methods and activities in the conduct of gaming, a tribal gaming operation shall not employ that person in a key employee or primary gaming management official position. (5) Provide an opportunity for a hearing on the denial of a license, or for such other cause as the Commission may determine. The Commission's decision on licensing is final although the applicant may petition the Commission for re-hearing in cases where they have new evidence to submit, or where they can demonstrate that the Commission made an error in their decision. (e) Standards of Suitability. The Gaming Facility shall not employ an individual if there is evidence and documented history of unsuitability or if they pose a threat to the integrity and/or safety of the gaming operation or its employees. The Commission shall create policy regarding additional standards of suitability and the application of those standards. The following minimum standards and criteria shall be applied when determining an individual's suitability to obtain or retain a gaming license from the Commission. These standards may be applied in any case where there is cause to question an individual's suitability, whether the cause arises from an individual's criminal history or from his/her reputation, habits and associations identified during the background investigation process. (1) Criminal Offenses: The Commission will view suitability for a license as diminishing in direct correlation to the increased severity of the offense or offenses that appear in one's record. The Commission will take into account the severity of the crime and the number of crimes and other offenses that a person's background investigation reveals. Some offenses are identified in the Gaming Ordinance as being an automatic bar to a gaming license. In the event an individual's background investigation reveals a barring offense, they will be denied a gaming license. They may be eligible to apply for, and obtain, a Tribal Gaming Waiver. (2) Non-Criminal Offenses: In considering suitability where the background contains unconscionable acts, offenses and incidents other than those listed as a bar in the Gaming Ordinance, the Commission will consider any offense, situation or incident that could present a threat to the integrity of the gaming operation or present some threat of harm to the employees or patrons of the gaming establishment. These include but are not limited to violent acts against persons; verified reports or documented evidence of violence against persons without a criminal conviction; dishonest acts against an employee, person or institution with or without a criminal or ordinance violation; any type of verifiable wrong-doing that may present a threat or harm to the gaming establishment, its patrons or employees. (3) Length of Time Since the Occurrence in Question: The length of time since the date of conviction(s), charge(s), release from incarceration or dismissal from employment for dishonest acts shall be taken into consideration when determining suitability for licensing. Additional arrests within that time span will also be taken into consideration. (f) Issuance of Provisional Gaming License. A Provisional Gaming License is issued by the Commission to an individual when the following requirements are met: (1) The Compliance Department has completed a preliminary State criminal background check and informs appropriate human resource department that the individual is eligible for a Provisional License. (2) The Commission has reviewed the individual's preliminary background check. (3) The Commission has no notice of suitability concerns at this stage. (4) The individual is offered employment by the Human Resource Department at the Tribe's gaming facility. (5) The individual has passed his/her drug test. (6) The appropriate licensing fees have been paid to the Compliance Department. (7) The individual has provided fingerprints for his/her file. (8) The individual has returned a gaming license application to the Compliance Department. (g) The Provisional Gaming License shall be valid for no longer than (3) months from the date of issuance. (h) The Provisional Gaming License becomes void upon the receipt of a Primary Gaming License. If after the Compliance Department has completed a full investigation and the Commission finds the individual not suitable for a Primary Gaming License, the Provisional Gaming License shall be revoked and the licensing process shall cease. (i) The Commission shall not license individuals under the age of eighteen (18), except that, the Tribe may approve summer youth positions provided that those positions do not involve any duties performed within the actual gaming facility. These positions would not be considered \"key employee\" positions and would be excluded from the licensing process. (j) Standards for Denial of a Primary Gaming License. The Commission shall not license as a key employee or primary gaming management official in connection with Class II or Class III gaming, any person who: (1) Is under the age of eighteen (18); (2) Is currently cited or charged with or has been convicted of or entered a plea of guilty or no contest to: a gambling-related offense, theft, fraud or misrepresentation in any connection, the manufacturing and/or selling of illegal drugs or a violation of any provision of chapters 562 or 565, Wis. Statutes, a rule promulgated by the Lottery Board or Wisconsin Racing Board, or Section GMG.01.21(b) . This provision shall not apply if that person has been pardoned by the Governor of the State where the conviction occurred or has been granted a waiver by the Tribal Council pursuant to the Tribal Gaming Waiver policy; (3) Is currently charged with or has been convicted of or entered a plea of guilty or no contest to any felony, other than those mentioned in Section GMG.01.15(j)(2) , within the immediately preceding ten (10) years, unless the Tribal Council waives such restriction pursuant to the Tribal Gaming Waiver policy. (4) If person has participated in organized crime or unlawful gambling or is a person whose prior activities, criminal record, reputation, habits and/or associations pose a threat to the public interest or to the effective regulation and control of gaming, or create or enhance the dangers of unsuitable, unfair, or illegal practices and methods and activities in the conduct of gaming or to the carrying on of the business and financial arrangements incidental to the conduct of gaming. (5) Is found to have intentionally supplied false or misleading material information or has intentionally omitted material information on his/her license application or application for employment. (6) Provided further that the Commission may, by regulations, add additional limitations and conditions for denial of said license, subject to the approval of the Tribal Council. (7) Applicant or employee with a Deferred Judgment for a barring offense is ineligible for an Employee Gaming License until such Deferred Judgment is dismissed or applicant or employee is granted a Tribal Gaming Waiver pursuant to the Tribal Gaming Waiver Policy. (8) Is found to have been convicted of possession and/or use of illegal drugs, unless the Commission deems that the individual does not present a threat to the public interest or threaten the effective regulation and control of gaming during a show-cause hearing. (9) The applicant or employee violates any part of Section GMG.01.21(b) . (10) The applicant currently holds a valid gaming license from another gaming facility, or has a financial interest in or management responsibility for a gaming related contractor. (k) Notice of Results of Background Investigations. (1) Before issuing a Primary Gaming License to a key employee or primary gaming management official, the Commission shall prepare a notice of results of the applicant's background investigation to submit to the NIGC. (2) The notice of results must be submitted to the NIGC within sixty (60) days after the applicant begins working for the Tribe.

(8) Except as specifically identified in this ordinance, in no event will the individual trust accounts be subject to any preferred claim by the beneficiary or guardian; nor are any rights created between the beneficiary and the Tribe; nor shall the principal and interest in the trust accounts be shielded from claims of general creditors under applicable federal or Tribal law. (9) In the event the Tribe seeks bankruptcy protection or insolvency, or the Trustee believes or has reason to believe that the Tribe is unable to pay its debts as they become due, the Trustee shall cease payments to beneficiaries and shall hold the assets of the trust accounts for the benefit of the Tribe's general creditors. (10) Beneficiary's trust accounts may not be anticipated, assigned (either in law or equity), alienated, pledged, encumbered or subjected to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process. (d) No Retroactive Payment. Any person enrolling in the Stockbridge-Munsee Community after June 1, 1995, except as otherwise specified herein (see Section GMG.02.07(b) ), shall not be entitled to any back payments of per capita proceeds. The first per capita payment to a new tribal member shall be on the first date of a regularly scheduled payment after his or her qualified status is confirmed in accordance with Section GMG.02.07(b) . (e) Federal Tax. The Tribal Council or its appointed agent shall ensure that notification of the application of federal tax laws to per capita payments authorized by this Plan be made when such payments are made. The Tribal Council or its appointed agent shall also implement a procedure by which qualified tribal members who receive per capita payments shall have applicable taxes automatically deducted from per capita payments, in accordance with 25 C.F.R. \u00a7290.12(5), 26 C.F.R. part 31, and 26 U.S.C. \u00a73402(r). (f) Judgments for Obligations Owed the Tribe. The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribe may, in its discretion, determine that the per capita distribution may be withheld for payment to the Tribe for amounts due the Tribe and established by a court of competent jurisdiction by judgment with any remaining funds being distributed to the individual. In the event that the obligations of the tribal member are non-monetary then the tribal member's per-capita payment will be withheld until the individual satisfies the obligation. If the individual has failed to comply within thirty (30) days, then the tribal member's per-capita payment for that particular year will be returned to the Net Gaming Revenue's General Welfare Fund. Examples include but are not limited to a tribal member refusing to vacate a tribal housing unit, failing to complete community service, etc. In addition to any other tribal remedies, the tribal member's per-capita payment would be withheld. If the individual continued to fail to vacate or perform community service as required, then the tribal member's per-capita payment would be returned to the Net Gaming Revenue's General Welfare Fund. Said withholding may be done by voluntary consent of the debtor or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, even if the debtor chooses not to accept the per capita payment. In any event, all funds withheld shall be reported to the appropriate taxing authority as income for purposes of federal taxation. (g) Judgments for Amounts for Child Support. The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribe must withhold Tribal Court ordered child support, as provided for in Chapter YAE.09 , from a tribal member's per capita distribution in accordance with this ordinance. Said withholding may be done by voluntary consent of the debtor or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, even if the debtor chooses not to accept the per capita payment. In any event, all funds withheld shall be reported to the appropriate taxing authority as income for purposes of federal taxation. (1) If there are no judgments owed to the Tribe under Section GMG.02.07(f) , then up to 100% of the tribal member's per capita distribution may be withheld for child support. (2) If the Tribal member has obligations both to the Tribe under Section GMG.02.07(f) and for child support pursuant to Section GMG.02.07(g) , then the following table shall be utilized. (A) 50% of the per capita distribution will be allocated to the Tribe for satisfaction of judgments owed to the Tribe under Section GMG.02.07(f) . (B) 50% of the per capita distribution can be applied to amounts owed for child support regardless of the number child support orders. (C) If there is more than one child support order, than the allocation for child support should be apportioned equally among the child support orders. (D) In the event that the amount owed under either Section GMG.02.07(f) or (g) is less than 50% of the per capita distribution, then the remaining amount shall be allocated for the payment of the other debt. (E) In the event the amount owed under both Sections Section GMG.02.07(f) and (g) total less than 100% of the per capita distribution, the remainder shall be payable to the tribal member. (h) Except as provided for in Section GMG.02.07(f) and (g) and as a pledge to secure funds borrowed from the Tribe's loan fund against a discharge in bankruptcy, future per capita payments may not be anticipated, assigned (either in law or equity), alienated, pledged, encumbered or subjected to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process. Any attempt to assign, alienate, pledge, encumber, attach, garnish, levy, or execute an agreement regarding a future per capita payment will not be valid or legal, and will not be enforceable.

{"body": "Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code Section SAF.02.18 \u2014 Condemnation Of Unsafe Buildings (a) Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this section. (1) \"Building\" includes any building or structure or part thereof. (2) \"Department\" refers to the Land Management Department. (3) \"Owner\" includes the owner of a building or structure, the person holding the underlying tribal land assignment, if different from the person who owns the building or structure, the person holding the land (if not a tribal land assignment) and the Owner's agent, if one is designated. (4) \"Unsafe\" refers to any building that is so dilapidated or out-of-repair as to be dangerous, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation or unreasonable to repair. Buildings are determined to be unsafe under the condemnation process. (b) The Tribe may condemn buildings that are determined to be unsafe in accordance with the processes outlined under this ordinance. (c) Departmental Condemnation Process. (1) Upon the Tribe discovering or receiving a report of an unsafe building, the Department shall investigate the report. (A) The Tribe shall inspect or have the building inspected. Such inspection may be by tribal staff or by other authorized individuals. (B) In the event that the building is occupied, then the Tribe shall obtain the occupants' permission prior to conducting such inspection. (C) In the event the building is occupied and the occupants do not grant permission for an inspection, then the Tribe may obtain an inspection warrant from the Tribal Court. (i) The Tribe must show that probable cause exists that the building is an unsafe building. (ii) The mere existence of a report shall not constitute probable cause; rather, other articulable facts must be presented to the Court. (iii) The Tribal Court shall schedule hearings in relation to the granting of the inspection warrant in an expedited manner. (D) In the event of an emergency situation where a building is believed to be an imminent danger to life or limb in the community, an inspection warrant shall not be required even if permission is not granted. Tribal staff shall be accompanied by a tribal officer or conservation officer for any such emergency inspection. (E) The Department shall take such other actions as necessary to reasonably investigate whether the building is unsafe. (2) Following the investigation, the Department shall issue a dated, written report with its conclusion as to whether the building is unsafe. (A) This report should include the reasons why the Department concluded the building is or is not unsafe. (B) The report shall also include recommendations on what, if anything, should be done for remediation. For example, the Department may recommend that a building be razed since it is unreasonable to repair or identify if the building can be made safe by repairs. (C) The report shall identify if the unsafe building constitutes an emergency situation that is a serious threat to life or limb or may result in irreparable injury, loss or damage. (3) A copy of this written report shall be served on the Owner, if known. (4) Notice of the report shall be posted on all of the building's exterior doors. (A) This notice shall, at a minimum, identify the date that the written report was issued, the date the notice was posted, the Department's conclusion as to whether the building was unsafe, identify how the Owner can get a copy of the report, and identify any timeframes for the Owner to take action. (B) If the condition of the building warrants consideration as an emergency situation and/or requires that the building be vacated immediately, the notice shall identify such special considerations. (5) If the Owner disagrees with the Department's conclusion, then the Owner shall have 30 days to contest the report from the latter of the date that the notice of the report is posted or the date of service on the Owner. (A) When an Owner disagrees, then the Owner must provide a written statement identifying why he/she disagrees, including supporting information, and identify what changes to the report are requested. (B) The Owner may also request a meeting with the Department to discuss the report. However, if the Owner wishes to contest the report, the Owner must still submit the required written statement. (C) This opportunity to contest the report is waived in emergency situations where the unsafe building is a serious threat to life or limb or may result in irreparable injury, loss or damage. (6) The Department shall review any written statement contesting its report and, within 30 days, issue a letter either confirming the original report or issue a revised report. (7) The Owner shall have 60 days to implement the Department's recommendations. This timeframe shall be calculated from the latter of either the date of the Department's report (if not contested) or, if the report is contested, the date that the report is confirmed or revised. (A) This time shall be counted from either the date of the Department's report (if uncontested) or, if the report is contested, from the date the report is confirmed or revised. (B) This timeframe may be extended upon a showing by the Owner that such an extension is necessary and appropriate. (C) In emergency situations where an unsafe building is a serious threat to life or limb or may result in irreparable injury, loss or damage, this timeframe may be expedited to be less than 60 days. (8) The Owner shall be responsible for all costs associated with implementing the Department's recommendation, as well as the Department's costs to implement and enforce this departmental condemnation process. (d) Tribal Court Process. (1) In the event an Owner fails to implement the Department's recommendations regarding an unsafe building, a tribal officer or conservation officer may issue a citation for a condemnation violation to the Owner. (2) When a citation is issued for the failure to implement the Department's recommendations in an emergency situation, then the Tribal Court shall schedule any hearings in the matter in an expedited manner. (3) The Tribal Court may consider the reasonableness of the Department's recommendations as part of a hearing on a condemnation violation. (4) If the Tribal Court upholds the Department's recommendations, then the Tribal Court shall order that the Tribe may take such actions as are necessary and appropriate to abate the unsafe building. The Owner shall be responsible for the costs to abate the unsafe building, as well as any fines levied under this ordinance. (5) If the Tribal Court upholds the Department's recommendation that a building be razed, then the Owner shall have up to thirty (30) days to vacate the building and remove any personal property. Personal property that has not been removed within this time will be deemed abandoned and disposed of by the Tribe. (6) If, as part of a court proceeding, an unsafe building that is capable of repair is turned over to the Tribe, then the Tribe shall act as receiver and hold the building until it is sold or disposed of consistent with the following requirements. (A) Any building sold under this provision is sold with the condition that any unsafe conditions that were identified must be remediated within a reasonable timeframe. (B) The Tribe shall attempt to sell the property by public sale for a bona fide cash offer to be paid within forty-five (45) days of the public sale. (C) The proceeds from any such public or private sale shall be first used to satisfy any indebtedness secured by the building, then any indebtedness owed to the Tribe based on the condemnation proceedings, and any remainder shall be paid to the Owner. (D) If no offer is accepted at the public sale, then the Tribe may sell the building by private sale. (E) The Owner shall have no interest in the proceeds if the building is sold by private sale. (F) In the event there is no private sale, then the building may be disposed of by the Tribe and the Owner shall have no interest in the proceeds.

(7) The license fee is waived for service dogs, including dogs that provide assistance to persons who are blind, deaf, or mobility-impaired, but such dogs still require a license. (c) Animal Health. (1) Dog and cat owners shall have and maintain a current rabies vaccination for their dog(s) that have reached 5 months of age. (2) If a dog or cat that bit a person is believed to be infected with rabies and can be safely captured, then the animal will be captured and put in quarantine. (A) If quarantine cannot be imposed since the animal cannot be captured, then the animal shall be killed in a humane manner and avoids damage to the animal's head so that it can be tested for rabies. (B) The quarantine shall be under veterinary supervision and shall be as necessary to prevent health risk to humans and animals. (C) If, at the end of the quarantine period, a veterinarian certifies that the dog or cat has not exhibited any signs of rabies, then the animal will be released from quarantine. (D) If it is determined that it is not safe or appropriate to quarantine an animal, then that animal may be euthanized in a humane manner that avoids damage to the animal's head so that it can be tested for rabies. (3) If an animal other than a dog or cat is believed to be infected with rabies, then a tribal officer or conservation officer may kill or order that animal be killed in a humane manner that avoids damage to the animal's head so that it may be tested for rabies. (4) The owner of an animal suspected to be infected with rabies shall be responsible for the costs associated with keeping the animal in quarantine and/or the costs associated with examination of the carcass. (5) No person may import, sell, transport or exhibit an animal that is exposed to or infected with a contagious or infectious disease.

The Tax Commission has the power and authority to collect any Taxes assessed under this Tax Ordinance. (b) Return And Payment. (1) A Seller required to collect the Tax imposed by this Code shall pay the Commission the Tax collected during the preceding Period, not later than 30 days following the end of the preceding Period. At the same time, the Seller shall file with the Commission a Return and remit amounts owed in a manner prescribed by Stockbridge-Munsee Tax Regulations and Tax Commission. When it appears that the Return filed by a Seller does not reflect the Tax due under this Code, the Commissioner shall assess the Seller for the deficiency, interest, penalties, and costs, and the Seller shall be liable for the same. (2) If no return is timely filed, the Commission shall make an estimate of the Tax due and assess the Seller responsible for collecting the Tax due under this Code for that Tax, including interest, penalties, and costs. This assessment is binding on the Seller unless shown to be clearly erroneous. (3) If a Seller fails to provide information within its possession or control that is relevant to a determination of taxes due and which it is required to provide under this Code, the Commission shall make an estimate of the Tax due and shall assess the Seller for that tax, including interest, penalties, and costs. Such assessment is binding on the Seller unless it is shown that the assessment, on the basis of the best information available to the Commission, was clearly erroneous or unless the Commission for other good cause shown relieves the Seller from the operation of Section TAX.01.22 . (4) After a Return is due, the Commission may make any examination of the records and accounts of the Person making the Return that it deems necessary for determining the correctness of a Return, or to determine the amount of Tax due if no Return is filed for a Period.

Such notice shall be given either personally or sent by registered mail to the address listed on the Return, or to the Seller's last known address if no Return is filed. If the Tax paid is greater than the Tax found to be due, the excess paid shall be refunded to the address listed on the Return. (c) No Waiver Of Sovereign Immunity. Nothing in this Tax Ordinance or in the Tax Regulations, nor any action of the Tax Committee shall be considered a waiver of the Tribe's Sovereign Immunity. (d) Delinquent Liabilities.

In such action, the Tax Commission shall have the benefit of all applicable laws providing remedies against property or rights to property, real or personal, of the Person liable for the assessment. (e) Demand For Collection. A notice of assessment requires the collection of the amount by the date therein; and, any amount of Taxes reported in a Return filed by a Taxpayer or otherwise due pursuant to the terms of this Tax Ordinance and not paid by the due date are collectible as of that date without further notice. Absent a stay granted pursuant to this Tax Ordinance, the amount of the notice or the report amount not paid is a delinquent liability and is subject to a demand for payment issued to the delinquent Taxpayer to commence collection action.
